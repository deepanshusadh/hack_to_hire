3188,Would Genoa forward Piatek fit in at AC Milan? Would he be able to pursue his impressive scoring streak?,"[""I think he fits well, but don’t expect him to score as often as before\n Let’s begin by saying that Piatek is overperforming his expected goals by ~40% at the moment, scoring at a rate of 0.73 goals per 90 mins. He is unlikely to maintain this over the rest of the season (see [LINKED_TEXT: Understat] [URL: http://understat.com/] radar below)\nThat being said, his numbers are really, really good for someone who played in one of the poorer offenses in Serie A. In terms of shot quality and volume, Genoa are the 6th poorest offense in the league. Piatek was practically half of Genoa’s attacking output, both in terms of expected goals (0.5 xG per 90) and actual goals.\n These stats are simply a reflection of a player who is truly gifted at finding and attacking spaces. Look at a compilation of his goals with Genoa, and it’s essentially a handbook of good striker movements.\nPowerful and expertly-timed runs behind defendersWhen receiving a cross or cutback, he often slows down and adjusts his runs to trick defenders and give himself more time and space to strike the incoming ball.[LINKED_TEXT: “Ghosting” movements] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Ronaldos-art-of-ghosting-is-a-rare-exploit-in-soccer-What-other-players-have-used-this-type-of-off-the-ball-movement/answer/Jos%C3%A9-P%C3%A9rez-4?ch=10&share=b8d64a47&srid=nyuC] similar to those of Ronaldo and Icardi.Really good at making low, driven shots from a variety of positions and situations in the boxNot super tall (6 ft / 1.83m), but has excellent jumping and heading techniqueHe also occasionally comes short to help his midfielders and provide a passing outlet. He then lays off the ball with a simple, efficient and intelligent first touch.\nBut how will Piatek fit in at Milan?\n [LINKED_TEXT: I was assigned to cover last Saturday’s Milan v. Napoli for Between The Posts] [URL: https://betweentheposts.net/ac-milan-ssc-napoli-paqueta-and-piatek-leave-good-first-impression-at-san-siro-in-goalless-but-entertaining-draw-0-0/], so I had the opportunity to watch Piatek’s debut with the Rossoneri. He was subbed in around the 70th min, but even in that short span of time, he changed the game.\n Napoli still dominated possession in the final 20 mins of the game (60% to 40%), but Milan could now punish Napoli’s attempts on the counter by sending passes into space for Piatek. The timing and power of his runs kept Albiol and Koulibaly constantly on edge, to the point he forced a yellow card on Albiol.\n I talk about this game vs. Napoli because it exemplifies the biggest advantage Piatek has over the departed Higuaín: speed and power. Higuaín is one of the greatest goal scorers of the last decade, but he’s 31 now. He’s slower, not as physically dominant. He plays in deeper positions now because he doesn’t have the speed and power to constantly run into space and pin down defenders. This means he can’t get into good scoring positions as often as before. This is reflected in his numbers, as explained by Statbomb’s Ted Knutson: Higuaín’s shot volume in the box has decreased significantly over the last two seasons.\nLooking around media takes today, I'm surprised our podcast take on Higuain ended up quite so contrarian.His trending the last two seasons - and especially his shot volume from 12 yards or closer, which has a knock on for xG - is VERY worrying.\n— Ted Knutson (@mixedknuts) [LINKED_TEXT: January 23, 2019] [URL: https://twitter.com/mixedknuts/status/1088086859664801792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nMilan definitely has creative deficits (everything depends too much on Suso), but Higuaín’s physical decline also hindered their attack. Creating great chances not only requires great playmakers, but also players who excel at attacking spaces and getting into scoring positions. Higuaín’s increased struggles in this latter aspect made it harder for Milan to turn their possessions into shots, and it heavily hindered their counterattacking capabilities.\n Fortunately, Milan has also done another great signing to compensate their creative deficits: Brazilian midfield talent Lucas Paquetá. They needed a midfielder like him urgently, and he’s had an immediate impact on the quality of Milan’s possession game. Against Napoli, for example, he was providing much needed passing options in between the lines. And with his outstanding passes and controls, he created great passing combinations with Çalhanoğlu on the left side, which allowed Milan to progress despite Napoli’s pressing block.\n So all in all, I’d like to think the tactical context for Piatek in Milan looks favorable. Milan is improving on their creative deficits with Paquetá, and Piatek will be an improvement on Higuaín when it comes to attacking spaces with speed and power. Let’s hope this can translate into more goals for the Polish striker. I repeat, however, that I don’t expect him to maintain his outstanding scoring rate of 0.73 goals per 90. If he could keep scoring at a rate of ~1 goal every 2 games (0.5 goals per 90) that would be quite good!\n"", ""Do you speak about Piatek?\n No idea. I think he overperformed and it was confirmed by stats.\n Still, he showed good qualities. But could he reproduce it at Milan?\n If Higuain, a world class striker, at 20–25 goals/season don't score there, I don't think Piatek could do much better. Milan real problem is the whole system, all their attacks are predictable, and they don't create enough situations.\n Gattuso, players, I don't know, it lacks creativity, risks, it's really worrisome.\n"", 'ACM issue is the middle of the field, it has been for the past ten years or so, since all the champions (Pirlo, Seedorf, Gattuso himself, etc) left.We currently play with Kessie and Bakayoko, as promising they may be in their own role, they don’t create plays, we over rely on Suso as he is the only creative player at UCL level player in our team at the moment.\n we could play with Cristiano Ronaldo & Messi and we still would have these issues.\n']","[Document(metadata={'top_answers': [""De Bruyne's first injury didn't affect City much because some players stepped up and took the mantle while he was gone, his second injury won't cause major problems either.\n One of those players who stepped up was Bernardo Silva.

This left Manchester United without a centre forward during counter attacks.\n Sir Alex Ferguson noticed this and started to buy centre forwards to play alongside Rooney.

But these reasons were right but never felt just right to me.\n I mean take the example of his contemporaries : Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.\nWayne Rooney gave his 200% on the field. Carlos Tevez was ready to give his everything on and off the field. Though, they were successful too but despite being almost similarly talented the difference between their success and Cristiano’s is significant. How an annoying young winger who dribbled way too much became one of the best in the entire history of football.\n So one fateful day I saw a video of football pundits taking about him which I almost skipped because I thought they were gonna repeat the same reasons.\nBut Matthew Syed, a british journalist and table tennis player, said these lines by taking Cristiano as prime example:\nI think that these athletes are deeply paradoxical in that when they are on the stage and they have got a big match they have enough self belief to deliver, they execute brilliantly. But when on the training pitch they have the humility to say, “Even though I am good, I need to get better.” They work on their weaknesses. They build their weaknesses. They have their essential humbleness.\nHe epitomizes these linee. In short, “Even Cristiano is arrogant in the football match, he is the most humble guy on the face of the Earth when it comes to training.”\n And unlike many footballers, he accepted that this was the only way he would be the best at a very early age.\n Tevez in an interview proved this point.\nHe spends the entire day in the gym, it's an obsession. I remember that we needed to train at 9, I arrived at 8 and he was already there. So I tried to arrive at 7:30 and he was already there. One time I did everything to get there before him, I arrived at the pitch at 6:30, but he was already there.

Milan has been struggling with finishing chances, and Piątek's clinical finishing ability could be just what they need. He's proven his prowess in Serie A with Genoa, and there's no reason he couldn't continue that form at Milan. The team's style of play and the service he would receive from players like Suso and Çalhanoğlu could even enhance his scoring streak.\n\n**Answer 2:**\nIt's always a bit of a gamble when a player switches teams mid-season, but Piątek has shown remarkable adaptability. He's a poacher who thrives on crosses and through balls, and AC Milan certainly creates enough chances for him to continue his impressive scoring streak. Moreover, with the Rossoneri pushing for a Champions League spot, having a prolific striker like Piątek could give them the edge they need.\n\n**Answer 3:**\nWhile Piątek's goal-scoring record is impressive, it's important to remember that he's still relatively new to Serie A. Moving to a bigger club like AC Milan comes with increased pressure and expectations. If he can handle that and maintain his composure in front of goal, there's no reason he can't continue to score consistently. Plus, playing alongside more skilled teammates could even elevate his game. However, it's also possible that he might need some time to adapt to his new surroundings."" response_metadata={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 518, 'total_tokens': 889, 'completion_tokens': 371}, 'model': 'mistral-large-latest', 'finish_reason': 'stop'} id='run-8983569c-0dac-4dfe-810d-cad6b071495c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 518, 'output_tokens': 371, 'total_tokens': 889}",0.25086505190311414,0.49310344827586206,0.3325474724146779
3189,Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?,"['Don Trump was rated the worst president in American history by the Political Science Association in their respected survey. As a nazi-praising, tariff-raising, anti-NATO, anti-American president, he set the bar as low as it could go.\n He’s a president who largely did nothing while 500,000 Americans died of Covid—except pretend there was no such thing as Covid.\n As a leader and a person, Mr. Trump is somewhat of an abomination.\n Could Clinton Do Better?\n Could Mrs. Clinton do better than ‘the worst’? It’s unlikely she would do worse. She understood how the U.S. gov’t worked. She had foreign policy experience. She was sensitive to the challenges of children and the poor. She practiced etiquette and had a sense of decency.\n In these things, she was positioned to be a better leader, better steward, and to better serve the country.\n So, of course, she had the intellect and temperament to do better. Easily so.\n Would she be successful?\n That’s different though than saying she would have been successful. With the exception of Don Trump, she was the most negatively viewed politician in America. I think if she would have won—she would have faced unprecedented challenges including some form of obstruction and disinformation:\nThe senate, led by Sen. McConnell, was prepared to block her agenda—just as he had done against Mr. ObamaShe would have had a hard time confirming judges to the Supreme Court.With GOP majorities in both houses of congress, she would have had a VERY difficult time passing significant legislation\nHaving Said That\n There ARE things she would have accomplished:\nStronger NATO: Trump divided NATO and the U.S.’s standing across the world plummeted. Clinton would have worked better with foreign allies.Russia faces consequences: Russia DID tamper with our elections. If elected, Clinton would have called them out and punished them. Not bowed down at their feet. She would have also had the world’s support (See #1)Different tariff policy: Clinton’s tariff policy would have likely been different. Tariffs are paid for by Americans in the form of higher prices for goods/services. Clinton would have saved each U.S. family about $1,000/year.Covid: While there’s no way to say that Clinton would have reacted faster, she would not have pretended Covid didn’t exist either. I think we can say that the U.S. response would have been more coordinated, less expensive (agencies not bidding against each other), and we would have provided more leadership worldwide. Trump gets credit for developing the vaccines…but otherwise, his Covid response was a failure and is largely the reason he lost re-electionNo praising Nazis: Clinton would not have excused Nazi behavior. Nor stoked it. As a result, many of hate groups (Proud Boys etc.) would be much less powerful and less a threat to the countryFunctioning Gov’t: Trump left many vacancies in many departments…basically crippling them and making them unable to function. Most notably, the U.S. Post Office, the I.R.S. and the State Department. Clinton would not have impaired basic government functionLess Corruption/Graft: No administration is corruption-free, but Don Trump’s was the most corrupt in our history…by far. Along with his family’s self-dealing, he had the most corrupt campaign staff, the most corrupt cabinet, and the most corrupt administration. Worse than Nixon. Many went to jail, were forced to resign, or were ethical failures. Trump’s family used the positions for personal profit.Less disinformation: Clinton would have faced disinformation from Fox and Facebook…but she would not have stoked it, energized it, and made authoritarianism a tool in the playbook.More stable America: If Clinton had won in ‘16, much of the destabilization of our country by Trump (Jan. 6 and the anti-democracy members of the GOP) would not exist…or at the very least been delayed by 10 years or so.Better immigration: For 20 years, America had its lowest levels of immigration into the country. Then Trump lied about there being a crisis and set up detainment camps…Unnecessary. With Clinton, immigration is actually dealt with—more effectively and without traumatizing kids and embarrassing the nation\nVerdict\n Much of Clinton’s positives would have been addition by subtraction. Maybe she doesn’t have a ton of legislative or judicial accomplishments, but she does help the country side-step the disaster that was Don Trump. She was competent, knew and respected our history, and would have strengthened our foreign relationships.\n She’s not perfect. According to reports, she can be indecisive and vindictive. She was despised by many in the GOP. Many would not have liked her.\n But I think she would have benefitted the health of the U.S. public and our gov’t, too, been competent, and actually served the country.\n', 'In many ways, HRC would’ve been the best - certainly the best-prepared - POTUS ever. Her entire life - education interests, experiences - had been building toward this.\n An accomplished lawyer, and first-class mind, who’d gotten experience as a Senator, Secretary of State, and FLOTUS, the latter being very active, as she spearheaded the efforts to enact universal healthcare, for Bill. In this capacity she headed committees, and took part in hearings, against the best the GOP could throw against her. To even mention DJT in the same breath, is an affront to her lifetime of service and excellence.\n Unfortunately she ran afoul of three trends. The first was in the unrealistic scrutiny women are under, compared to men, and especially DJT. She was even tarred by the brush of Bill’s illicit affairs, while DJT got away scott-free, WRT his OWN affairs.:\n The second was the hatchet-job the GOP had been doing on her, since Arkansas, a situation certainly not helped when she spearheaded the moves to try to enact universal healthcare, during Bill’s tenure, nor by her attachment to both Benghazi, and the e-mail-server issue\n Finally, there was the pathological approach that the media took to her and Bill - but particularly her - again, since Arkansas:\nReporter Jonathan Allen once exposed a secret that’s kept among journalists who want to sell subscriptions and create clickbait for a media outlet: ‘Write as though the Clintons are the purest form of evil. The same holds for daily reporting. Want to drive traffic to a website? Write something nasty about a Clinton, particularly Hillary.’\nI can’t wait to read her memoirs, looking back on it all:\nYeah, imagine the world - literal WORLD - of difference, had the EC not existed, in 2016…\n', 'A sewer rat would make a better president than Trump. Not to say Hillary Clinton is so low. Hillary Clinton actually is very intelligent, well educated with a degree in law. She’s been involved in politics much more than a traditional First Lady and while she may not have been the ideal progressive candidate she would have undoubtedly followed a centrist democratic stance the sort that her husband did to balance the budget and maintain the status quo while doing well with the economy, Wall Street did very well under Bill and Barack. As President Clinton did, President Obama inherited a terrible economy and turned it around by doing the very simple thing of cutting corporate and billionaire tax cuts by a few percentage points and cut federal subsidies, i.e. pork spending to the military manufacturers. They both greatly reduced the unemployment rate, slowed the skyrocketing curve of health care costs and made commitments albeit not enough towards improving the environment. They were however not without their faults and were up against very divisive republicans in congress that would rather destroy the American economy than see a democratic president succeed.

I also never watch ‘reality’ shows, because the only ‘reality’ aspect of these silly shows is that the cast are not high profile celebs. I vaguely knew of trump, but never really paid him much mind and watched the Apprentice only a few times. How the show became so popular was a mystery to me; how could anyone enjoy people gossiping and back stabbing each other. I guess the catchphrase ‘you’re fired’ is what made the show.. But I digress… I also didn’t really pay much attention to US politics, except to realize that the US electoral system is strange, cumbersome and WAYYY too long. I couldn’t figure out how such a large country could function properly IF the Congress and president were at odds and fighting each other.. Doesn’t make sense to me. Anyway.. One day I happen to catch part of the RNC debates between the potential candidates… Seems a few of the ‘debaters’ were exchanging insults and barbs about the size and effectiveness of their ‘packages’. WTH???\n I tuned into CNN & MSNBC a few times (we don’t get fox news in Canada). Most of the evening hours were spent discussing Trump. So I decided to do some checking on this ‘phenomenon?’\n What I found were articles spanning years that showed trump to be a very poor businessman, with thousands of lawsuits, several bankruptcies and many failed business adventures. In fact, if he hadn’t received MILLIONS from his father, he likely would be a low level used car salesman. I read the story about his failed venture into the Casino game in Atlantic City. He got several really BIG breaks on his property taxes and chicanery by his father which allowed him to scam investors in the casino. The Taj Mahal Casino also was fined under the RICO act and also for discrimination. The casino failed, the investors lost their money and trump walked away with approximately $600,000. There were lots of articles indicating that trump had some pretty close connections to mobsters and other criminal elements.\n I found several articles about his cruelty, discrimination and outright meanness as a landlord/developer. He was charged a couple of times for discriminating against colored people; he was exposed as using predatory tactics like cutting off the heat & water to rental properties he owned in order to force the people out, so he could raise the rents.\n I learned that many, many buildings bearing the trump name were not owned by trump. Instead, he was pimping out his name and getting lucrative ‘management’ contracts for said buildings. There were also several scandals regarding failed property developments where trump advertised that he was the developer and/or an investor.\n During his campaign, three scandals became public… Trump University where he was sued for defrauding his ‘students’ and that the university was in essence a variation of a Ponzi Scheme. Then it was revealed that trump charity gave big donations to the election campaigns of AG’s in Texas and Florida and the investigations into his phony university were dropped. That led to investigations into his charities and evidence that several trump ‘charities’ were using donor monies for the benefit of trump & co.\n Then came the tape where trump bragged about being a sexual predator. That alone would have finished any other candidate, but suddenly, the FBI announced it was re-opening the investigation into HRC’s e-mails. The ensuing media coverage of that drowned out the ‘p***sy grabbing tape, although Billy Budd suffered the fallout. After 16+ women came forward and confirmed that he was indeed a sexual predator who also walked in the dressing rooms to ogle the naked teen contestants of his beauty contests. At this time a lady came forward and accused trump of raping her at J. Epstein’s estate when she was a young teen. The statute of limitations passed, so she was suing him. The case never went to court and the results remain a mystery - payment and a NDA? During this time, trump said ALL those women were lying and he would prove it after the election. Almost four years later and we’re still waiting. Then he bragged that he didn’t pay taxes because ‘he was smart’, but he promised to close the loopholes that allowed ultra rich people like him to pay next to nothing in taxes. He was the ONLY candidate who did not release any tax returns (standard practice since the Nixon days). He said he would release them after the election. Almost 4 years later and not only has he NOT released his returns, but is using every tool available (including flunky Mnuchin) to keep them hidden. He not only DID NOT close the loopholes, he added more loopholes, because those multi-millionaires and multi-billionaires need to keep their $$$$$$$$$$.\n I watched a couple of his hate fest rallies and they were disgusting. He ranted and raged and insulted practically everyone on the planet. The rallies in many cases reminded me of uncontrollable, violent lynch mobs.\n So, after all this, I thought there is no way in hell that this crude, vulgar, petty, barely coherent man could get elected — he should have been in jail!\n When he was elected, I thought his term would be a disaster. It is WORSE! It has proven to be an absolute, chaotic, debacle, travesty of a clown trainwreck. The ‘swamp’ that he promised to drain has become a giant, stinking, scum filled cesspool of clueless, brain dead, self-serving, reptiles of the worst order.\n Well here we are in year four of the most corrupt, cheating, lying, scamming, obstructing, petty, vindictive, vulgar, cruel, ignorant, anti-american, unchristian, power abusing, incompetent wannabe dictator to ever defile the WH. Even more amazing, he STILL has 40% support!

Yes, that’s part of the system.\n Any municipal department of a city or town is the city or town controlling a resource, but in the interest of providing it to all eligible citizens. Water, sewer, trash collection, electricity, sometimes even cable TV, Internet and telephone service. Alaska leases out its oilfields and gives every Alaskan citizen a check every year. All socialist.\n Here’s the funny thing: ask your relative if these things are socialist. I’m willing to bet that your relative will say that none of these are socialist except perhaps Obamacare.\n The standard modern right-wing definition of socialist seems to be “government programs I disapprove of.” Many of them don’t recognize socialism when it hands them a check, educates their kids or maintains their roads and parks. *cough* Sarah Palin *cough*\n I’m not going to win any prizes pointing this out, but the US is a capitalist-socialist hybrid country with a weak and tattered welfare state, many of our citizens blind to the socialism we have.

Clinton’s track record isn’t that of a socialist of any stripe. Instead, she’s proven herself pliant and friendly to corporate interests, all for bailing out banks and keeping them deregulated, for trade agreements that put corporate interests ahead of sovereignty or the public good. (It’s better-explained here: [[LINKED_TEXT: Bernie Sanders Vs Hillary Clinton: Comparing Neoliberalism To Democratic Socialism On Issues] [URL: http://www.inquisitr.com/3174833/bernie-sanders-vs-hillary-clinton-comparing-neoliberalism-to-democratic-socialism-on-issues/]])\n For context, socialism is a spectrum of political/economic organization, which ranges all the way from state-ownership-of-industry to we’re-still-capitalists-but-regulate-markets-in-the-public-interest. Clinton lands somewhere well off the spectrum, way over in neoliberal-corporatist-land, where instead of wanting government to check corporate abuse, they see the proper role of government in service of big business (or apparently, in service of folks who can afford high-powered lobbyists).\n For all that conservatives are constantly assured that democrats like Clinton (and Obama, for that matter) are secret socialists, that’s just propaganda to keep them riled up. The truth is a bit worse; establishment Democrats since the Reagan era have been of the same neoliberal stripe; they might be liberal on social policy (like women’s rights and marriage equality) but in economic terms they’ve internalized as correct the sense that the government’s role should be to strengthen corporate hands in terms of suppressing organized labor, keeping wages low, exploiting foreign labor and resources, and outsourcing public functions (like prisons and schools and warfare) to private interests.\n In this sense, Clinton might as well be a Republican- they like all the same things, in terms of economics, corporate welfare, trade policy, and keeping bank regulators toothless. But they’re going to stoke up the socialism propaganda to keep your attention focused on that stuff.\n This is all kinda fascinating to watch, in the sense that so much of America’s success is so closely related to where it’s cultivated public wealth, assets, infrastructure, and safety nets. Part of America’s success is connected to such socialist undertakings as Social Security, Medicare, Interstates (gasp, freeways instead of tollways?), ports, the military, your fire department, police, and all the other common infra/services that enable so much more. To watch us use Socialism like a political boogeyman when we use so much of it (as though we didn’t) is at least a little entertaining.\n', 'Honestly, your friend is right to be wary. But not of Hillary; she ain’t socialist. Your friend’s not only looking at the wrong person, but the wrong generation too.\n We Millennials grew up in a post-Soviet world. Our experience with socialism is limited to looking at Western Europe, where we see an apparent success story. We are really warm to the idea of democratic socialism. Bernie Sanders may be an old Socialist, but his movement this cycle was a Millennial movement. College students were crazy for the guy.\n We didn’t see what happened to the Soviet Union firsthand - we were children, infants, or not even born at the time. We didn’t get the anti-Socialist propaganda that our parents did - or nowhere near as much of it, at any rate.\n Now, some of us saw a glimpse into the troubles of modern-day socialism with the European Debt Crisis, seeing how Greece, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, and Ireland found themselves on the ropes. But Germany bailed ’em out, and I think that blunted the lesson we should have learned. Maybe later, when Europe’s troubles resurface (I have a hunch they will - problems that deep don’t get solved that easily), more of us will start to see socialism differently. But until then, there’s a considerable chance that we will push the USA in a more socialist direction.\n There’s another likely outcome, however. Just like the hippies of the Vietnam era, we may simply be passing through a starry-eyed phase with regards to our attitudes to socialism. The historical trend of becoming more conservative with age may mellow us out. But even so, there’s a strong chance that we push the nation towards a more socialist path before we become conservative. Time will tell.

Is this true?')]","content='Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J. Trump? This question is complex and depends on one\'s perspective and priorities. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Experience**: Hillary Clinton has extensive political experience. She served as a U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and as the U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. She also has experience as a First Lady, both at the state and national level. Trump, on the other hand, had no political or military experience before his presidency.\n\n2. **Policy Knowledge**: Clinton is known for her detailed policy proposals and understanding of the political process. She has a long track record of advocating for specific policies, such as healthcare reform and women\'s rights. Trump, meanwhile, often relied on broad strokes and slogans like ""Make America Great Again,"" and his policies were sometimes criticized for lacking detail or consistency.\n\n3. **Temperament**: Clinton is often described as calm and measured, while Trump is known for his impulsive and sometimes volatile behavior. Some argue that Clinton\'s temperament would have been better suited to the diplomatic and negotiating aspects of the presidency.\n\n4. **Scandals and Controversies**: Both Clinton and Trump have been involved in numerous scandals and controversies. While Clinton faced criticism for her use of a private email server while Secretary of State and her response to the Benghazi attack, Trump faced numerous controversies, including the Russia investigation, the Ukraine scandal that led to his impeachment, and multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n5. **Vision for America**: The two candidates had very different visions for America. Clinton\'s platform focused on incremental progress and continuing many of President Obama\'s policies, while Trump campaigned on a platform of dramatic change, promising to ""drain the swamp"" and disrupt the established political order.\n\nIn conclusion, whether Clinton would have made a better President than Trump depends on what qualities and policies one values. Some might prefer Clinton\'s experience and policy knowledge, while others might prefer Trump\'s disruptive approach and policy agenda. It\'s also important to note that the presidency is greatly influenced by the political and historical context, and it\'s impossible to say with certainty how a Clinton presidency would have unfolded.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 2736, 'total_tokens': 3257, 'completion_tokens': 521}, 'model': 'mistral-large-latest', 'finish_reason': 'stop'} id='run-ddf50792-808a-4322-b30e-640e1acfec1d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2736, 'output_tokens': 521, 'total_tokens': 3257}",0.31464435146443515,0.48764044943820223,0.38249088799559344

Small weapons, flags, and other significant personal items are examples of such items. We want to know if this practice is still being used today.\n Do soldiers thus take enemy weapons? Even when they are running low on ammunition, most soldiers stay away from hostile weaponry. They run the danger of not knowing if the opposition is using it as an offensive tactic. Similarly to this, if a soldier is untrained in using an enemy weapon, there may be little sense in picking it up. Therefore, the army discourages its service members from considering the employment of enemy weaponry for safety grounds in order to protect their soldiers.\n In this article, we examine military tactics to see if combat medals are becoming obsolete. Are soldiers permitted to use enemy weaponry when engaged in combat? Can they keep them as mementos and what are the rules? You can learn the answers to these and other questions by reading on.\n Can Soldiers Pick Up Enemy Weapons?\n In some situations, a soldier's final resort can be to take an enemy weapon in hand. Other times, such as in guerilla warfare, the situation is so critical that the soldier's ammunition choice is the last thing on his or her mind.\n Depending on how conventional the army is and it's fighting regulations, different laws apply in this circumstance. One of the rules in this situation is that the soldier may take whatever appropriate action as long as it doesn't jeopardize the security of their squad. However, these regulations are set by the Special Forces and the relevant fighting units.\n In conflict, it's generally not a good idea for soldiers to use the enemy's weapons, and some strict warriors won't even think about it when they're out of ammunition. Some people even believe that leaving a weapon that can be used around for their adversary to find and use against them is a sign of weakness. Similar to this, what good is taking up a weapon if it can only be used by the correct hands?\n Find out why it's not a smart idea to use your opponent's weapon.\nLevel of Training\n Before engaging in combat, every soldier goes through specialized training that is tailored specifically to the kind of weapon they will employ. Consequently, it is useless for them to pick up a weapon for which they have no training.\n If they use it in any other way, it might seriously harm them or their fellow soldiers. Since many soldiers have died from these weapons because they were used incorrectly, it is recommended to stay away from opposing weapons.\n In addition, several weapons self-destruct if a foreigner attempts to use them. For instance, a soldier might take out the bolt, reveal the pin, insert it into the hole, and then snap it off to completely incapacitate the gun for the subsequent user.\n Sabotage Tactics\n The battlefield can be fairly challenging because you never know what strategy your adversary will use to corner you. First, the opposing side might grab their weapons and sabotage or rig them; as a result, the weapon might malfunction or blow up when it is fired.\n In addition to jamming adjacent weapons, this tampered ammunition may also render your troops defenseless. One approach to sneak into the enemy's camp is to leave modified weapons lying around. Therefore, the majority of soldiers choose to employ their own artillery.\n Friendly Fire\n Some firearms may sound the same when fired, as you may have noticed. For instance, the M-4 and AK-47 both have similar sounds. A soldier should therefore stick to their own weapon if both sides are using these weapons. If not, they might be making themselves a target for both sides, which would be a self-defeating strategy.\n Safety\n Before deciding to take an enemy's weapon, safety must come first. Every soldier is aware that there are a few things to take into account before approving a firearm for usage. They must be able to disassemble, clean, and reassemble it. By doing this, you can be sure that the gun is secure and hasn't been rigged or booby-trapped.\n In addition, the soldier's gun is probably in the crossfire given that they are down. As a result, if it is also struck, it could be destroyed or have its barrel twisted, which would affect the shot's accuracy. Such a weapon is dangerous to anyone utilizing it because it has a high risk of exploding, especially under back pressure.\nCan Soldiers Keep Captured Weapons?\n Which nation a soldier is fighting for determines whether they are allowed to keep the weapons they have taken. Countries like the US have severe laws that ban soldiers from keeping guns they have taken and compel them to return any weapons they have taken to their unit.\n Weapons and personal belongings are among the goods that are kept as a tradition in armed conflict. The successful side or the battle hero benefited from this tactic. It was a display of bravery and a blatant sign of the victorious side in the conflict.\n The soldiers may still value this highly; hence, they may want to keep enemy weaponry as mementos. But is it permitted by law?\n Generally speaking, different nations and combat units have their own laws regarding the retention of looted enemy property. When a team seizes a weapon, it may be treated as a war prize in some nations.\n After labeling them, the appropriate authorities seize them and put them on display. Each firearm receives a designation based on the method of capture. Heavy armament, such as trucks, ships, and airplanes, are subject to this practice. For smaller ammunition, such as rifles and pistols, however, they take them and put them on exhibit in other institutions.\n However, according to US practice, any time a soldier finds an enemy weapon, they must give it back to their squad. It will be properly disposed of by the parties involved; they will either destroy it or render it inoperable. They break the receiver and remove the bolt from small-caliber weapons like pistols and firearms, rendering the weapon utterly worthless.\n Larger weapons are destroyed by explosions or airstrikes if they are there. Their primary worry is that the adversary might find them again and use the weapons against them. If they are destroyed, the enemy cannot take them back.\n The legislation is fairly strict in forbidding soldiers from seizing and keeping enemy weaponry, either for use or as a memento. The best course of action is to declare that you are in possession of it and then provide it to the appropriate persons for disposal.\n The idea is that since a soldier fights for their country, anything he acquires or captures during the conflict belongs to it. The leaders of the unit will choose the next course of action with regard to the weapons, captives, or the land.\n If a soldier still chooses to keep enemy weapons, it would be against the law and punishable. They can only keep such a weapon by keeping it illegally, which is strongly advised against.\n Finally\nThe wisest course of action would be to refrain from picking up or using any enemy weapons at all; yet, some soldiers believe it to be an essential action in battle. Many veterans of past wars, such as the world War, admit to picking up enemy ammunition during altercations. They even claim that it was a smart approach that might have helped them win the battles.\n Due to their scarcity, it was necessary to seize these weapons, which also increased their ammunition supply. However, if the army is organized and well-supplied, its own artillery will be sufficient. The US Constitution forbids the storage of firearms belonging to enemies. It is therefore advisable to stay away from it; else, soldiers will be doing\n If you liked the answer Upvote and Follow\n"", ""In the US Military, things are almost always planned for. There are rally points, fallback locations, rest/refuel/re-arm spots. Additionally, soldiers (or airmen, seamen, or marines) are never alone, even a two-man team is unusual. A soldier (or airman, seaman, or marine) who is out of reach of his unit, is not going to happen (under most circumstances, in these modern times). A platoon or squad will know that they are in the red with ammunition (red meaning low, black meaning too low to be mission capable). They know it's time to call off the mission, call for backup, or rally to a previous location. Command usually does not want a mission to fail, so the unit will almost always be able to get the ammunition or backup that they need.\n Sometimes, however, contingencies fail. Sometimes, units get ambushed, and a soldier might possibly become separated from any surviving team members. Sometimes, stuff just happens, and it would be folly to say otherwise.\n It is generally considered bad form to pick up an enemy weapon.\n 1. It is immoral to “loot” dead soldier's.\n 2. It is against US Army regulations to loot dead soldiers.\n 3. It is against the laws of war and Geneva Convention to loot dead soldiers.\n 4. If you want the citizens of the country you are in to trust and like you (as in the Iraq War), then you do not do the things that the Ministry of Misinformation (actually called Saddam's Ministry of Information, but we called it like we saw it) tells the people that you will do. E.g. looting, raping, pillaging, needlessly killing innocent civilians, etc. You instead act cordially and humanely to the populace that you are “liberating”. (I used quotation marks because while we might see it as liberating, their opinion might differ)\n 5. Enemies have been known to booby-trap weapons. Even dead soldiers have had the forethought to ensure that their death takes out other enemies. I don't have any research or evidence; but, I was told stories (from multiple SNCOs) about enemy soldiers lying face down dead, who were rolled over, and the enemy soldier held a live grenade, without a pin, under him, which exploded, taking out his enemy. If I am not mistaken, this was stories about the VC in the Vietnam War.\n 6. The weapon that the enemy has is not a weapon that you are proficient with. (Imagine being skilled in using a short sword, and you pick up someone's longsword, you aren't going to be as good with it as the ones who train with it). It is the same with firearms. Even a specialized soldier who has trained on multiple weapons and can pick up any weapon and be proficient, will tell you that he will use it sparingly, because he knows that he is at a disadvantage to an enemy who uses it everyday.\n 7. You have not cleaned or maintained that weapon (do you even know how to take it apart? Which pieces need the most lubrication? How to perform immediate action, when it misfires?). The enemy may not have cleaned or maintained it very well either. (Such was the case with a majority of the AK 47s and other weapons and equipment which we found in Iraq).\n 8. Ammunition. What are you going to do when you run out of that ammunition.\n 9. Soldiers (airmen, seamen, marines) know the sound of their weapons fire. They also know the sound of the enemy's weapons fire. You don’t want to make yourself into a target of your own troops.\n All that being said, if a soldier (aitman, seaman, or marine), or even a team, that finds himself alone with no ammunition, no means of communication, and no guidance, will definitely take the risk of picking up an enemy weapon and using it rather than be defenseless. No command is going punish you for doing so either. It should be noted that if you are found to have picked up and used one, unauthorized, without necessity, you could face military charges for it.\n If that soldier still has it in his possession when he is reunited with his command, he will have to relinquish the weapon. Under no circumstances, is the enemy weapon going to be able to remain in his possession, once he is on friendly ground.\n So, no, it is not allowed. Yes, extenuating circumstances could make it excusable. No, its not a good idea, even under the most extreme duress. Yes, even though it is a bad idea, if it is your last choice, do so. Personally, I would rather hide than use an enemy weapon…because of the reasons that I previously stated, it has the potential to be more deadly of a decision than simply falling back, hiding, or playing dead.\n"", '“Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?”\nThe “capture and use of enemy weapons” has been a practice for hundreds of years, in hundreds of conflicts. Anyone who was awake in 2022 absorbed the reports of the Ukrainians successfully capturing and using millions of dollars’ worth of Russian equipment and ammunition.\n In more modern times the answer is still…occasionally yes, either weapons or ammunition and sometimes larger items. It comes with risks. You must weigh risks against potential benefit. The authority of use captured weapons is typically a matter for decisions by local commanders. The determination is highly situational and should take into account both the benefits and the downsides.\n During the Spanish Civil War, German forces used captured Soviet tanks, which were considered in many respects superior. Both sides in that war used small arms and ammunition captured from the opposing forces. During WWII many countries made use of captured weapons, vehicles, and munitions. The Germans put captured French tanks into service, along with the small arms and ammunition seized from other nations. Typically these items were used in rear-area security rather than front line units.\n During the Vietnam war, US forces gave its troops “familiarisation” courses on the small arms used by opposing forces, both to provide knowledge of characteristics and to provide instruction in the use of captured weapons. A number of Americans, in special forces units and otherwise, occasionally made use of captured Soviet bloc weapons and ammunition, despite the denials of some latter-day non-participants.\n In 1982, UK forces made use of some captured Argentine equipment that was NATO-compatible. That included not just the argie 7.62 NATO ammunition at Goose Green but also in the final days of the war, argie 81mm mortars and .50 cal machine guns were captured intact with stocks of ammunition and those weapons were subsequently used against their former owners. At least one UK troop used a captured argie FN FAL (similar to the UK SLR) but there some problems in using UK SLR magazines in the FAL so argie magazines had to be used. Not an ideal situation. But the point is this: despite the bullshit from the unschooled Americans on this forum, the use of captured weapons and ammunition is occasionally done.\n Image: captured argie .50 cal subsequently used against Argentine troops\n———-\n The NATO 105mm artillery projos captured at Goose Green were considered for UK use but I don’t know if that actually happened.\n After the battle for Goose Green, some of the UK forces involved were nearly out of 7.62mm. The Argentines still had phenomenal amounts of ordnance near Goose Green and although they made some attempts to destroy or booby-trap some of it, a great deal of 7.62mm NATO ammunition was safely available and thus was taken up for their own use until normal resupply could be achieved.\n Again: the practice comes with risks.\n Most of these were not usable - just to illustrate the amount of material abandoned by the Argentines. And some of it was booby-trapped.\n Fast forward to the 2022 Ukraine war. Millions of dollars/euros worth of captured Russian equipment, including artillery, tanks, missiles, and other weapons and munitions, is a prominent feature of the war. So when someone from the US tells you that captured enemy weapons aren’t to be used, remind them politely or otherwise that they are simply out of touch, out of their depth, and full of shite.\n[LINKED_TEXT: A Captured Kalashnikov Has Become a Status Symbol in UkraineRussia appears to be using its invasion of Ukraine as an opportunity to put the AK-12, the most promising model in the AK series, through real-battlefield testing.https://sofrep.com/news/kalashnikov-ak-12-assault-rifle/] [URL: https://sofrep.com/news/kalashnikov-ak-12-assault-rifle/]—————-\n Ukrainian use of captured Russian equipment\nUkrainians with captured Russian ordnance to be put to use.\nUkraine: weapons captured from opposing forces, many considered suitable for use by Ukrainians\n']}, page_content='question: Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?'), Document(metadata={'top_answers': ['a nice big pool/hole and a lot of area into trouble. hope your township was empty and you were not in a city. speed means more power at impact with Earth and also want the meteorite was made from, was it small by the time it got to your backyard/target 0,0,0,0 or was it still big. the answer would give us why we got a problem or a huge death zone. at that speed locals would get the result before any warning so at speed of sound and maybe even faster and movement the death zone would expand outward and the Earth would have a new nature event to visit later hopeful. so enjoy your house and do the upgrades and raise your family and meet your neighbours. at that speed it might be partly a airbust event which would cover a large area but also reach down to the ground. good luck on the day. it be a day to remember if you away from home. keep your pets safe also.\n', 'To maintain that much velocity through the atmosphere, it would have to be huge and you would die.\n If it were only a few pounds, it could slow to a few hundred mph/kph, and further slow coming through your roof, and might only give you bruise.\nBut if it was still going Mach 32, it must be very large, carry tremendous energy with it, and unless you owned thousands of acres / hectares, you wouldn’t survive the shower of impact debris it generated.\nYou’d go down as the first known human, killed by a meteorite.

And if you tell the school you’re planning to get police involved, they are quick to want to solve the issue.\n When my my son was in kindergarten, him and his brother who was in 2nd grade use to ride the bus to grandpas after school and I’d pick them up an hour later. I walked in one day to find my kindergartener pouting on the couch. Figured he’d got in trouble until my dad said “show your mom” my son was “student of the week” they send home a pig paper to fill out about your kid favorite color favorite book siblings pets etc. I’m sure you’ve seen them. A 5th grade boy on the bus had drawn penises and wrote some foul things all over it. I called the school Monday and explained why we didn’t do it. They sent home a new paper and said they would talk with the boys who had done it. 3 days later the same kid had taken my sons backpack and wouldn’t give it back. We never got the backpack back, the school said they would talk to him. The next week he took my sons shoes while on the bus and the bus driver had to get them back while 5th graders taunted him for being a crybaby about his shoes. On Friday my kindergartener got off the bus wailing and holding his face. The 5th header had punched him in the face for “tattling” my father did not wait to inform me. He loaded both kids into his truck and headed for the school. I feel like I should say, my dad is a Vietnam vet. he’s a big man and he can be very intimidating. He’s also got a booming voice that carries well. When he got to the school he was informed that there was no one available to meet with him they were in meetings. My dad loudly explained that someone would talk to him, or he’d call the sheriff to the school and report the kid to have him picked up for assault. And the kids parents could deal with the court system and that further, since the school had opted to not handle the situation, he would be pressing charges against the school and the principal personally for child neglect and endangerment. The principal made time to talk to him suddenly. She explained that there was little to be done, they didn’t have an interpreter at the school and the parents spoke very limited English. They couldn’t remove the other child from the bus because it would cause his family a hardship as neither parent could drive. My father whipped out his cellphone and called the sheriff station right there in the office. By the time the cops got to the school, the school was trying to find an interpreter and get hold of the other boys parents at the same time. The cops took a report, found a Spanish speaking officer and headed to the other boys home. Turns out the family was undocumented and it took a pretty shitty turn for that family after the police visited.\n I’ve used this a couple of other times also. If you tell the school you are getting the police involved, they suddenly care. Or skip telling them. If you or your child is being assaulted, you are not required to report it to the school first. You are within your rights to call the police and seek legal justice against your attacker.\n', 'When my 23 year old son was in 8th grade, he had issues on the bus with a 7th grader. My son had been bullied verbally by this kid for at least a year and a half ( since the kid enters middle school ).\n This kid found him on Facebook and messaged him there. Since I was monitoring his Facebook at that time I read the messages and replied back warning him that I was not my son (he didn’t believe me) and if he continued I would file charges for not only harassment but cyber bullying. He deactivated his account after that.\n My son was really good at ignoring him. What happens when a bully gets ignored? He ups his ante. It came to a head one day when my son came home with scratches on his arm, a fist sized bruise on his back and a knot on the front side of his head near his temple. I of course asked what happened. Kid didn’t like being ignored anymore so as my son was preparing standing up to get ready to get off the bus, kid grabbed his arm. My son jerked his arm out of kid’s hand and said don’t touch me again. Kid punched my son in the back which in turned pushed him causing his head to his the section of bus in between the windows. I was done.\n Called the school. They can’t do anything because it didn’t happen on campus (never mind the fact that the bus is school property as well as the bus stop where fighting is a suspendible offense.) so they suggested I call the police. I did.\n A very nice officer came out and took his statement as well as photos and we showed her the messages. Didn’t need a visit to the ER cause the number on his head wasn’t as bad as it looked but was cautioned anyway about looking for signs of concussion. She asked if I wanted to press charges. I told her honestly all he and I wanted was for kid to stop and to leave my son alone. She said that she would leave the case open for one year and we could file at anytime if he continued.\n She came back a couple of hours later to tell us she had visited the kid and his mom. Mom was not surprised about kids action but panicked when told that I was well within my rights to press charges but I chose not to at this time provided kid leaves my son alone. Ultimately kid was suspended from the bus for 10 days then he disappeared from the school for the rest of the year. My son found out later that he was pulled out of that school and was put into an alternative school.\n So to answer your question yes you can file a police report.\n', ""On the last day at the end of the school year my son in grade 6 was beaten up by 2 grade 8 students. My son is very quiet and really smart. The principal threw up his hands and said there was nothing he could do being the last day. While my wife drove our son to the hospital I called the police and asked what to do. The cop told me I was really stupid if I didn't report it. I did. The tone of the school really changed when two cruisers showed up and took the kids. They later photographed my son's injuries. One kid pled guilty and the other’s parents hired a lawyer because he had been in trouble before. Before court I told my son to be truthful and say what happened. During the cross examination, the lawyer who was trying to trip him up asked how does know who kicked him. My son replied the boot was connected to a leg on his body. He was beginning to show frustration after an hour of questions. The lawyer was also trying to get my son to speak louder by standing away from and holding his ear saying he had a bad ear.\n My son asked the judge if he could ask a question. The judge said sure, what is it? My son said “ which ear is bad, sometimes it's his left, sometimes it's his right”?\n The judge was trying really hard to stifle a laugh then he reamed the lawyer for his stalling tactics and ended the questions. Then the judge apologized to us in court for the lawyer's behavior. In the end there was conflicting evidence between all the witnesses so it was dismissed. Later the police officers involved apologized to us for what happened in court.\n So, in my books call the police and get directions from them how to proceed.\n Another point: the principal's primary responsibility is for the safety of the students.

A small fish in a large tank with heavy filtration may not cause any problem. If the tank has many scavengers they may eat the dead fish which may also prevent any problems from happening.\n Leaving a dead fish in the aquarium is much like overfeeding the fish. You put in excess organic matter that begins to decay. If this exceeds the filter’s capacity to break down nitrogenous waste you could have an ammonia spike or get cloudy water.

If the police found the bodies of two dead leprechauns in your trash can and a pot of gold in your basement, you would likely be facing a very unusual and serious situation. Here's why:\n\n1. **Illegal Disposal of Bodies**: Regardless of whether they are leprechauns or humans, disposing of bodies in your trash can is illegal. You could be charged with improper disposal of a body, which is a crime in many jurisdictions.\n\n2. **Potential Homicide Investigation**: The police would likely treat the leprechauns' deaths as suspicious. Even if you didn't harm them, you could be considered a person of interest in a homicide investigation. You would need to prove that you weren't involved in their deaths.\n\n3. **Theft or Possession of Stolen Property**: Having a pot of gold in your basement could lead to charges of theft or possession of stolen property, especially if the gold is linked to the deceased leprechauns. You would need to explain how you came into possession of the gold.\n\n4. **Wildlife or Endangered Species Laws**: Depending on where you live and whether leprechauns are considered a protected or endangered species (in a hypothetical world where they exist), you could face charges related to harming or killing protected species.\n\n5. **Public Relations Nightmare**: Even if you were innocent, the optics of this situation could be disastrous. The media might portray you as a leprechaun killer and gold thief, which could harm your reputation and relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while this is a highly improbable scenario, if it were to happen, you would likely be arrested and face multiple charges. It would be a complex legal situation that would require a strong defense. As always, it's best to stay on the right side of the law and avoid situations like this.

3191,Would a random number generator be more or less random than me just randomly saying numbers? Why or why not?,"['Well, the other answers say that people are shit at generating random numbers, and they’re not wrong, but for a strictly correct answer we need to clear up two things:\nAre we talking about a bona fide random number generator or a pseudorandom number generator?How do you want to measure randomness in the first place?\nIf the generator is pseudorandom, and you are using a strict definition of randomness such as [LINKED_TEXT: Martin-Löf randomness] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmically_random_sequence], then actually, the generator is not random at all: its Kolmogorov complexity given the length of the output sequence is bounded. In contrast, the numbers issued by a human might be somewhat random: the Kolmogorov complexity of an output sequence given its length may be unbounded.\n So the strict answer is that the human sucks, but the PRNG sucks harder, and the human ends up winning. It’s only once we relax either of those two criteria that the answer flips around:\nIf we use a true and perfect random number generator, then its output will be fully Martin-Löf random, and will be more random than a human can be.If we relax the notion of “randomness” to the intuitive notion of “difficult to predict” or “high entropy according to a model class that’s limited to not include pseudorandom number generators”, then of course even pseudorandom number generators look perfectly random, and will beat a human handily.\nSo the answers who claim humans are less random must be thinking of one of the two scenarios above, rather than the strict scenario.\n', 'Most people have a very skewed view of what makes a sequence random.\n For instance most people think that in a random sequence numbers rarely repeat (where as if you are picking 5 numbers from 10 possibles, the sequence 1,1,1,1,1 is just as likely as any other sequence of 5 numbers).\n Also people tend when given a large range to choose from, will choose a sequences that exhibits some level of clustering.\n People also have favorite numbers that they will pick, and also have numbers that they avoid.\n A pseudo-random number generator will use an algorithm that is specifically chosen so as to match the key criteria of random numbers :\neach value is equally likely regardless of preceding valuesEvery sub-sequence of n values is just as likely to occur as every other sequence of n values - although most PRNG are fixed with and therefore there is a practical limit to how large n is before this measure stops being true.\nIn general for most PRNGs - since they are based on a known set of operations, if you know the starting state you can predict the sequence of generated values; so they aren’t truly random - but normally the starting state is designed to be difficult to know (maybe the exact time including milliseconds). In general attempting to derive the starting state from the sequence of numbers is also impractical.\n', 'The random number generator will probably produce a sequence that passes statistical tests for randomness better than you just saying numbers, because it was designed that way. Like others have said, *trying to be ‘random’* can backfire because you are actually biased away from anything that seems to have a pattern, and there are likely to be certain numbers that you have an unconscious preference toward. However, I wouldn’t ascribe this to a general “lack of randomness” in human behavior, or an idea as one person suggested that “humans didn’t evolve to be random”. Biological organisms are generally significantly more random in their behavior than machines, and there are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, they are much more complex, so there are many more sources of random fluctuations, and secondly there actually is an advantage to it in some cases, i.e. sometimes the best strategy in certain forms of game theory is to be truly random. I recall once reading that there was an encryption program that used random movements of the user’s hand with the mouse to seed the algorithm because that was considered much harder to predict than the output of a PRNG. But that’s the details of muscle movement, not a deliberate thought process.

That is absolutely correct. But, the strength of a scientific understanding comes from scrutiny, and consensus - versus a formulaic number of repetitions.\n This scrutiny includes…\nCan it be replicated (as you’ve asked about?)This usually implies, replicated by someone else. This is needed not just to avoid outright fraud by unscrupulous scientists, but to ensure quality in the performance of the experiment (see number 2.)Is the experiment well designed and performed? Simply repeating a badly designed, or badly performed experiment will confirm the same bad results. Part of what peer review is supposed to do, is flesh out experiments that are inherently flawed in their design (so they give skewed or meaningless data) and experiments that are well designed, but badly executed (I.e. your process inadvertently introduced or destroyed protein products that would significantly alter the results, etc.)Do the data warrant the conclusions made? One must remember, experiments only generate data. Then the significance of the data, and the conclusions from the data must be deduced. Significance of the data takes two forms: Statistical significance, and (for lack of a better word) meaningfulness. Statistical significance is usually annotated by a [LINKED_TEXT: p-value] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value] which (simplified) means “We see a difference between the [LINKED_TEXT: Hypothesis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis] and the [LINKED_TEXT: Null Hypothesis] [URL: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/]. But what is the statistical probability that (in this one experiment) this difference may have occurred just by random chance, even if there’s really no difference?” Normally a p-value of 0.05 or less is considered “statistically significant.”The “meaningfulness” is more subjective. As an example, you do an experiment to see if drug A is different (better?) than drug B. You do the experiment, and you see a statistically significant difference in “factor X” between the two drug’s. But so what? While the statistical significance of “factor X” is certain, does this difference actually change how the drug works? Is it scientifically significant?\nAs for “how many (validations)” … this also is not really the best way to look at scientific validation.\n In addition to all the above formal ways, science is validated by the practical use of it. When a paper describes a new scientific conclusion, other scientists will build on that conclusion. They will recreate the experiment exactly as a form of validation, but they will also perform new research that builds on the previous discovery (which, defacto, determines if the previous discovery is “correct.”)\n For example, a scientist may conclude that inflammation is associated with chemical “Factor Y”. So others look at her/his paper, and agree that the experiment was well performed, and the conclusions seemed reasonable to the data.\n So, they start working on a drug to interfere with “factor Y” - with the assumption that removing factor Y should reduce inflammation. But, while they successfully removed factor Y with the drug, the inflammation does not decrease. So…Even though the experiment (at the time) was reproducible, and the design, execution, and conclusions were all well done … it turns out they were wrong. Maybe because of something they didn’t know yet. Maybe there is a “co-factor Z” that has to be involved too. Maybe for some other reasons. Maybe because the experiment was just wrong.\n But, the nice thing about science - is these things get teased out eventually. A lot of people (mistakenly) think that, “If it’s published - it’s just a scientific FACT!” But this is an oversimplification. Even if the experiment is reproducible, and the paper is well scrutinized - if enough people find the conclusions simply to not work in the real world, the “conclusion will be scrapped or otherwise altered to match what’s actually happening in the lab.”\n And this is wonderful because figuring out the details of why something does, or does not, work - simply leads to a better understanding of the something.

He’d run through my swings and attack my legs. I’d kick him. He’d come back.\n Finally, I’d had enough. If the damn cock went after my boy, who was then probably only four or five, he’d get him on the ground and fuck him up.\n We had to take the rooster out.\n My Hubby and I discussed the best method.

Last time we had to kill a few roosters, we went with the axe on the log and we thought we could do better with a gun.\n We were wrong.\n To make a long, gruesome story short, we ended up injuring the rooster and had to go into the coop to get him to end him humanely. He was bleeding. Badly. And this intrigued the hens. They ended up attacking him. I wrote out the details, but deleted them.\n It’s unnecessary to read the gruesome horror.\n Just know that I have never looked at a chicken the same way again. The way those hens looked at that rooster, the cock who had lead their flock, I guarantee it was the same way a dinosaur looked at its prey. Cocking their heads to the right. Then to the left.

This is very important as goats are escape artists. They are also very smart and can be trained to be as friendly and companionable as dogs.\n That said, you need to be aware of natural goat behavior. They are escape artists and that lovely rose bush on the other side of the fence is usually just the right enticement to make them think about escape. They also are very good at working out how gate latches work so you need to be creative in your gate latch. A sliding one is best as they are very good at figuring out the hook and eye ones.\n Also you will need at least a 5 foot fence or electric. This fence needs to be sheep fencing so they cannot wiggle through it. A wire strung at their eye level is a good deterrent.\n Also, goats will tend to get on anything that is higher than the ground. It is a natural instinct to be able to look for predators. Old wooden cable rolls are very fun for them to play on and fun for people to watch as well.\n Goats are browsers so while they can do well on a grass pasture, they do better on a weedy field with lots of brush. They are masters at clearing out blackberry vines.\n Anyway, goats are characters as you can see from the photo below. This is from a number of years ago of our goats all lined up at the fence looking for treats.\n', 'If you want a companion, I would first choose a human having a good disposition of the opposite sex. Goats and chickens are farm animals and not the best company. Chickens are easy to keep; but, not the sharpest tack in the box. The only thing on the farm with less intelligence is a sheep… dumber than dirt sheep are. Goats are very friendly, we often go on walks with them and sit and read while they browse. Goats are very intelligent and easy to keep as long as you have a good goat shed and room to store lots of hay for the winter (about 50, 40lb bales per adult goat). Both chickens and goats make fertilizer for the garden. The chicken manure has to compost for a year before use.\n When we hatch out new peeps (chickens just out of the egg) they are extremely cute and we enjoy watching them.

In the case of a horse, you can even ride them or ask them to pull a carriage…try doing that with a cat :-)\n But the logistics of keeping any of these animals as pets are pretty daunting…FAR greater than a more typical pet like a dog or a cat. They need a lot of physical space and infrastructure, feeding, and monitoring several times every day, and they produce waste in large quantities which has to be dealt with. Horse owners literally have to plan their lives around where they can live and animal care.\n Also, horses and donkeys with good care can live long lives (30+ years in some cases).

They can be very affectionate and playful, forming strong bonds with their human caretakers. They are also quite active and curious, which makes them entertaining to have around. If you have plenty of open land, goats will enjoy exploring and foraging, which is great for their physical and mental well-being.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that intact male goats (bucks) can exhibit some challenging behaviors, especially as they reach maturity. These can include:\n\n1. **Aggression**: Bucks can become aggressive, especially during the breeding season. They may butt, paw at the ground, and even charge. Proper handling and socialization from a young age can help mitigate these behaviors, but they may still occur.\n\n2. **Strong Odor**: Bucks have a distinct, strong odor that can be quite unpleasant. This is due to hormonal changes and is most noticeable during the breeding season.\n\n3. **Noise**: Goats can be quite vocal, and bucks may make a variety of noises, including a loud, distinctive mating call.\n\nTo avoid these issues, many people choose to keep wethers (castrated male goats) as pets. Wethers are typically much calmer, less aggressive, and do not have the strong odor that bucks do.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose a buck or a wether, it's crucial to provide them with proper care. This includes:\n\n- Adequate fencing to prevent escapes, as goats are notorious for their escape attempts.\n- Shelter to protect them from the elements.\n- A varied diet that includes plenty of browse (trees, shrubs, and brush), as goats are browsers, not grazers.\n- Regular veterinary care and hoof trimming.\n- Companionship, as goats are herd animals and do not thrive alone.\n\nIn conclusion, a willie goat can make a good pet for someone with plenty of open land, but it's essential to understand their needs and potential behaviors, especially if you're considering an intact male. If you're prepared to provide the care they need, goats can be wonderful, entertaining, and affectionate companions."" response_metadata={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 1415, 'total_tokens': 1963, 'completion_tokens': 548}, 'model': 'mistral-large-latest', 'finish_reason': 'stop'} id='run-623b339e-a7ab-4dc3-ac88-2905151b9ad8-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1415, 'output_tokens': 548, 'total_tokens': 1963}",0.2534246575342466,0.18625277161862527,0.2147076094090014

I hope the poem is reinstated, and that the Angelou work - which is also meritorious - is displayed ‘officially’ as well, with similar prominence (ideally with the rude verse included). Then, formal notification should be given that anyone caught defacing either work will be expelled without right of appeal.

Hooray! That’s one more of the bastards we don’t have to take the trouble to read!\n Have a look at If as though for the first time. It’s entirely bereft of muscular Christianity, or patriotic uplift, or endorsement of colonial robbery with violence. What it does is to advocate a slightly chilly emotional self-sufficiency, which it accomplishes with enormous skill - a quality desperately lacking in contemporary popular poetry. Being British, not American, I’m resistant to the homiletic in literature but this is a remarkably well-crafted and persuasive poem, not a cheap sermonette written for the improvement of salesmen. Interestingly (to me), I remember hearing a BBC radio programme years ago in which [LINKED_TEXT: Christmas Humphreys - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Humphreys], a Buddhist judge, chose If as one of his favourite pieces of writing. This, he said, was a perfect distillation of the aim of Buddhist life and practice.\n But of course, what the poem says isn’t the point here. Kipling has been given The Black Spot. Informed critics consider his short stories worthy of consideration alongside those of Chekhov, but he was wrong about colonialism (and I think he really was), so he can’t be allowed to enter a public space any more - clueless, pompous nineteen-year-olds have spoken. Well, fuck that - let Kipling in, and let him duke it out with Derek Walcott and CLR James. and Frederick Douglass and Chinua Achebe and Maya Angelou and Jackie Kay.\n A more difficult (and especially interesting) case is The White Man’s Burden - a great poem that openly endorses a despicable enterprise. Tom Paulin - a man emphatically of the left - recognised the skill and power of this entirely wrongheaded work and included it in his anthology The Faber Book of Political Verse. Lacking Paulin’s ethical and literary intelligence, the Manchester students spotted an unobjectionable poem by an author they disapproved of and treated themselves to a gratifying text-lynching. Wretched.\n -\n Note to my fellow left-folk: ‘problematic’ is a disparagement favoured by wankers. And so is ‘unhelpful’. And so is ‘inappropriate’.\n', 'There are no racist (or sexist) undertones in the poem “If”.\n Rudyard Kipling was born in India, and grew up with a more diverse viewpoint than most. He was proud of Britain at the time when it was the world\'s superpower, but he expressed many unique views, and used satire and criticism.\n He wrote ""You\'re a better man than I am Gunga Din"".\n He wrote ""There is neither east nor west, border nor breed nor birth, when two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth"".\n Mowgli was the hero of the Jungle Book story. This at the time of British supremacy.\n Kipling commented that the reason for military conquest was ""we had the Maxim gun and they did not"".\n In ""Fuzzy Wuzzy"" he wrote: "" We ’eld our bloomin’ own, the papers say,  But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us ’oller.  Then ’ere ’s to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an’ the missis and the kid;  Our orders was to break you, an’ of course we went an’ did.  We sloshed you with Martinis, an’ it was n’t ’ardly fair;  But for all the odds agin’ you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square. ""\n At a time when imperialists might talk about supremacy, he talked about reality, and wrote many poems from the viewpoint of the front-line soldiers, and admitted the defeats.\n His poem about ""Thomas Atkins"" describes the contempt between the aristocracy and the foot soldiers , except in times of war, when they went from ""Tommies"" to ""heroes"".\n In his poem, ""The Last Charge of the Light Brigade"", he takes the ""heroes"" of the Tennyson poem and describes how life treated the survivors twenty years later, starving on the streets.\n Kipling was definitely a supporter of his country, but he was not a ""racist"". He was using his skills to point out what was wrong, and find ways to fix the problems.\n I respect Kipling\'s opinions, and the way he expressed them. If you take a few surface words out of context you can justify any criticism you want, but if you read his works in depth, you get a different view of the man.\n', ""Of the lines painted over two are very poignant lines:\n Or being hated, don't give way to hating,\n and\n If all men count with you, but none too much;\n I find it ironic they were replaced with this poem, which I feel certainly in the UK is completely outdated, and could be read by those that way inclined to incite hatred and violence, and racism!

When she was about to kill over, I went and got a large tattoo of a few orchids on my ribs for her. I wanted her to see this before she died. I did not want to imagine what she would have to say about those tattoos. She happens to be lucid on the day I showed her and all she could say was oh my god. I was so happy it pissed it her off.

Since Balon offered his boy to the king on the sole condition that the king will keep him safe as long as Balon stays in line then that death will be equal to kinslaying which is a big taboo even on the iron islands.. The second reason was it gave mainland Westeros the opportunity to shape the heir to the iron islands the way they wanted him. Balon won’t live forever and Theon should have become more of a Stark then a Greyjoy. If Balon dies, he appoints someone else as heir and his heir decides to act silly then the crown would have a ready made substitution for him in Theon.\n By forcing him to become a member of the NW, Ned would lose the very purpose of having Theon in the first place\n a- the death threat would be gone as the North has no jurisdiction over the order. If Ned or Robert insisted to have him executed then the NW would be obliged to defend their member\n b- Balon could easily put a crown over his head and release the boy from his vows.\n', 'Theon committed no crimes when Ned was alive.\n Theon was around 10 years old when he was taken as a hostage/ward. He had committed no crimes. There was no reason for him to be sent to the Wall. If anyone, Balon could have been sent to the Wall. But not a 10 year old boy who didn’t partake in any rebellion.\n Theon’s purpose was to serve as a puppet. He grows up under Ned’s supervision, learns the ways of the north and understands the values he needs to abide by. He also befriends Robb, the future Lord of Winterfell.\n Once grown up, Theon would take over the Iron Islands. Perhaps, he only returns after Balon’s death. I doubt many would have opposed him at the Iron Islands if the realm was at peace, with Ned and Robert still alive. Theon would then run the Iron Islands and keep them in check under the supervision and informal command of Robb Stark.\n Theon at the Wall would serve no purpose.\n Perhaps in time, a northern girl (a Mormont or Karstark) could also be betrothed to Theon to strengthen the alliance between the north and the Iron Islands.\n', 'He’d have undone the whole point of warding Theon with the Starks in the first place.

In addition, Ned had the only child out of the main four families (Baratheon, Tully, Greyjoy, Stark) who was even close in age to Theon. By raising Theon in Winterfell alongside Robb (and, I guess, Jon), Robert and Ned and Jon Arryn hoped that the future leaders of two of the kingdoms would be close friends and as near to blood brothers as Robert and Ned were.\n And it would’ve worked, too, if it weren’t for those meddling squids.\n (And if Robb had just listened to his mother.)\n']}, page_content='question: What would happen if Ned Stark had sent Theon Greyjoy to join the Night’s Watch and serve on The Wall?'), Document(metadata={'top_answers': ['He seemingly had to be “OK” with it in both continuities because there was always at least some chance that it would get pulled off. There was no way to predict ahead of time that Jorah would be with her at that precise moment, or that he’d cotton on to the wine in time, etc. Too many variables were out of Varys’ control for him to not conclude that Dany’s assassination was “acceptable” if it occurred. Yes, he warned Jorah that there would be attempts, but all the same, all it would take was one to work. (And what if Jorah misses getting the warning message?!)\n Now, if he really wanted her to not be killed, all he had to do was just not hire the assassin in the first place and lie to Robert about the hit being a failure. But the attempt itself served a purpose by galvanizing Drogo to invade Westeros. Varys might have preferred it to fail, but the reward of actually going through with the contract was too big to pass up. Because, hey, maybe if Dany dies, Drogo still tries to invade Westeros to avenge her and Varys gets what he wants anyway. Varys gambled on it, and won (until Drogo died and Dany went off on her own), but he still could have lost and went in knowing that. It was an acceptable risk. He didn’t even warn Jorah of fake “attempts” to get Dany’s paranoia up and get her to appeal to Drogo to invade on that basis. He actually did send someone to kill her. The assassin failed, and maybe nine times out of 10 he fails. But, again, all it takes is that one time.\n I think it’s also important that at the time the job was discussed and likely at the time it was actually contracted out, Viserys was still alive and was also being targeted. Illyrio and Varys’ fake Aegon plotting (in the books) has shifted in many ways down the line, but it’s clear that Viserys and/or Dany not surviving to invade Westeros at all was a strong possibility — Illyrio tells Tyrion straight up he thought Dany would die with the Dothraki. If the invasion had happened, then the idea was probably to have Viserys/Dany and Robert beat each other up and for fake Aegon to swoop in and knock them both aside. But there was always a chance it wouldn’t happen, and — in Dany’s pre-dragon days — it looks like the Targaryen siblings were acceptable losses. Either Drogo would invade and then get booted out by fake Aegon (likely resulting in both Viserys and Dany being killed or re-exiled, etc.), or Viserys and Dany would go with the Dothraki and never return and be out of Aegon’s hair that way.\n On the show, Varys’ motivations are all over the map and pretty much take a total U-turn from seasons 1–4 and then seasons 5–8, for no obvious reason other than that without fake Aegon they had to rewrite his plot. Apart from Varys and Illyrio’s cutaway conversation that Arya overhears — which doesn’t make any sense in the grand scheme of things without Aegon’s plot — there’s no reason in the first half of the series that Varys is trying to help Dany. He’s doing intel work for Tywin in Meereen until almost the end of season 4 but then magically three episodes later, with virtually no explanation, he’s decided to throw in with Dany. Hmm.\n', ""You could answer this either way but I'm gonna lean towards the no side. Varys needed someone to create chaos in Westeros massively, at the time he probably knew a massive war was gonna break out but just incase he needed Daenerys and Viserys to come with the Dothraki and invade Westeros. Obviously without Daenerys the Dothraki don't come because they wouldn't follow Viserys so that would take them out if Varys needed an army to create havock in the seven kingdoms.\n Varys also told Jorah about the assassin and I don't think he would've done that if he wanted Daenerys dead. He needed someone to act the big bad and sit the iron throne, there wasn't necessarily a big bad during the beginning of the war so Viserys and Daenerys played the perfect part. So he needed her to live and come with Viserys and act the villain so FAegon seems like a hero when he comes to make his claim and get the iron throne.\n"", 'Definitively yes\n We need to remember that this is Varys we are talking about. Now, Varys pretty much has no oversight on this matter from any other parties. He’s basically free to do whatever he wants since he can always BS it to make it look like he did hire assassins even if he didn’t.\n So then given he actually did order the assassination attempt on Daenerys, it becomes pretty clear that he was totally onboard with this whole thing. And then again, this was also only ever brought up as a result of Varys bringing whispers from the East.\n So there’s really two levels at which Varys doesn’t have formal oversight and the ability to completely control all information regarding this.

This could mean that Robb Stark, his mother Catelyn, and his bannermen might survive.\n\n2. **Altered Power Dynamics in the North**: With Roose gone, the Bolton family would lose its powerful patriarch. This could lead to a power struggle within the house or allow other Northern houses to step into the vacuum. Ramsay Snow, Roose's bastard son, might not rise to prominence as quickly or at all.\n\n3. **Different Alliances**: Without Roose to negotiate with the Lannisters, the Boltons might not align with them. This could change the balance of power in the war. The Northern houses might unite under a different banner, possibly even returning to the Starks if Robb survives.\n\n4. **Potential Survival of the Starks**: If the Red Wedding doesn't happen, Robb Stark could continue his campaign against the Lannisters. While his chances of winning the war might still be slim, his family might not be decimated in the same way. This could also mean that the North might not be as weakened and vulnerable to other threats, like the Ironborn or the White Walkers.\n\n5. **Changed Storylines**: Many storylines hinge on the events of the Red Wedding. Without it, characters like Sansa, Arya, Bran, and even those not directly related to the Starks, like Brienne and Jaime, might have very different journeys.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even without Roose, the North is still a complex political landscape with many ambitious players. The absence of one key figure doesn't necessarily mean the North would be united or peaceful. Other characters might step in to fill the power vacuum, leading to different but equally complicated situations."" response_metadata={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 742, 'total_tokens': 1221, 'completion_tokens': 479}, 'model': 'mistral-large-latest', 'finish_reason': 'stop'} id='run-9f257653-9da4-4eba-ba63-41fb7f1dab88-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 742, 'output_tokens': 479, 'total_tokens': 1221}",0.3685152057245081,0.25495049504950495,0.3013899049012436
3195,"Would joining Ashoka university for BSc Physics be a good decision? As opposed to, say, DU or maybe IISER?","['Well B.Sc Mathematics both at Ashoka University and IISER Mohali is more or less the same and if a Student is coming from outside NCR or Punjab then he can go for either one as distance and locations would not matter much to him and the course structure and standards are also more or less the same.\n As for comparing DU with Ashoka or maybe IISER then these two institutes can never be near the top 3 colleges of DU – Stephens, SRCC and LSR. These are similar in Brand & educational quality to Harvard & Stanford of USA and Oxford, Cambridge of UK. Ashoka or IISER will never ever be able to provide that same Brand & Students profile (even if they provide Academic rigor). Other than these 3 top colleges of DU Ashoka is better than any other DU college. Of course the fees still would be of some concern but if money is not the primary consideration then Ashoka would be a clear choice of preference.\n Multidisciplinary course curriculum in Ashoka and IISER give them an edge over DU especially in the professional courses. Also the faculty at Ashoka would be a notch better than the DU. Ashoka and IISER being private institutions have a reputation to be taken care of and take the placements very seriously. Special care is being given to groom the students for the final event – the Placements.\n So from the trio of Ashoka, IISER and DU – Ashoka and IISER have the edge on DU, of course the top 3 of DU (Stephens, SRCC & LSR) are not taken into consideration.\n But if someone asks me for my honest opinion about doing a B.Sc Maths in NCR then Ashoka and IISER are topped by Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University).\n Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (Deemed to be University) also located at Greater Noida is perhaps one of the best institutes offering world class professional courses in streams of Management, Engineering, Science with Maths. Some of the differentiating features of B.Sc Mathematics course at Shiv Nadar IoE are:\nThe B.Sc Mathematics (research) program here is of international standards and very popular among the students aspiring to take up mathematical studies to become learned and qualified mathematicians.Shiv Nadar IoE offers a unique multidisciplinary B.Sc course offering foundation and major subjects at initial and later stages respectively, in the course curriculum.Faculty is top class and drawn from top universities across the globe.Shiv Nadar IoE also has excellent facilities both for learning and staying which are the best in the industry.Placements at Shiv Nadar IoE have always been very impressive being almost 100% in every placement drive. However, the placements in B.Sc Maths have been very few with most of the passing out students opting for higher studies.Students take pride in calling themselves as scholars of Shiv Nadar IoE.\nSo, in my personal opinion Shiv Nadar IoE is a much better choice than Ashoka, IISER and DU for doing a B.Sc Maths.\n', 'Ashoka University is highly underrated in my opinion. It has a very unique admission procedure and very top notch facilities. I would recommend it for basic sciences.\n Honestly speaking, I don’t think DU is at the league of IISERs or even Ashoka. DU might be excellent for art and commerce related fields, but for sciences, it doesn’t come at the top for me.\n Ashoka and IISER both are growing rapidly, and honestly I don’t feel you would lack opportunities if you select any one of them. Being from IISER, I will naturally be a bit more inclined towards supporting my institute, so if you ask me I’d choose IISER over Ashoka.\n Also, if you think the fees is a bit daunting (almost 10L per annum), don’t worry much. They give financial aids. According to their website, 39% students received a 100% waiver on tution fees, along with a waiver on hostel fees.\n', ""It's definitely a good option, however, it doesn't really matter too much.\n Ashoka has been growing rapidly, and I'm happy to see a liberal arts institution develop like this. However, you need to look into what the course structure has to offer, and compare it with other options. If given the choice, I would, for example, prefer IISERs usually, and Mohali specifically.\n""]","[Document(metadata={'top_answers': [""Choosing between Electrical and Electronics Engineering in BITS Pilani and pursuing an MSc in Economics depends on your interests, career goals, and aptitude.

But I would reframe the question to ‘What should I choose, a dual degree or a BTech in IIST?’ because one is not better than other. It is just different.\n Dual degree program at IIST is for people who are interested in pure science rather than engineering aspect of it. The five fields offered for a dual degree are different from Aerospace or Avionics. In a general sense you can say that if you are interested in pure research at a later stage, then you can choose a dual degree program. It helps you save an year when you decide to do a PhD later.\n But, it is not neccessarily the case. I did BTech in Aerospace Engineering at IIST and worked in ISRO for 3 years. But, since I was interested in fundamental research (which doesn’t seem to happen a lot in ISRO), I pursued MS in Sweden and now I am doing my PhD in Netherlands. When I took Aerospace, I didn’t know whether I wanted to research or not. You are also too young to know whether you want to do research in atmospheric science or astrophysics, or whether you want to work in ISRO and build rockets and satellites. So, in my opinion there is no wrong choice here. Whatever you choose, you can always change later.\n If you are very well informed as a kid and are interested specifically in Astrophysics/Astronomy or Earth sciences, then take dual degree because that will increase you chances of working in Space Physics Lab (SCL) or Physical Research Lab (PRL) which are mainly focused on fundamental research in Astronomy and Earth Sciences.\n If you are an engineer by heart (if you like building things and if you like Jugaad) then by all means go for BTech.\n I hope this helps.

3196,Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?,"[""Thanks for asking. I’m sure by now, all the other respondents have warned you about how big and heavy such an asteroid would be, or that, generally speaking most asteroids are thought to be “flying gravel-piles”. They are bits of smaller, older material that have accumulated into a single mass through weak gravitational attraction, though likely not in a way that “cements” the thing together as a single rigid body. The second you introduce a spin sufficient to simulate a fraction of one Earth gravity, the individual particles of our flying mountain will be flung off into space by centrifugal effect.\nThe best way to turn an asteroid into a space habitat is to skip the whole “Rama” scenario and just mine the metals you need to engineer a purpose-built structure. NOW… Having said that, let’s us take a little detour. Say you arrive at your asteroid in your handy-dandy Acme brand spaceship. Then you notice your target asteroid is spinning. Hint: Most (ok, all…) asteroids have a slow spin. You could lasso the asteroid along a circumference which is perpendicular to the major axis of spin, then attach the other end of the tether to your shiny spaceship… and push off. As you reel out the tether, your spaceship will increase separation. At some point, I would imagine you might need to expend rocket fuel to stabilize your ship at the end of this tether where it would act like a pendulum, or more accurately, like a bucket of water held at arms length while spinning around and around. No expensive or self-destructive spin-rate change, no risk of disintegration, no mining. Just pull up, rope the rock, spool out, and… Viola! Artificial gravity in a cool, comfy spaceship!!!\nThere are no new ideas under the sun as the saying goes, but I cannot recall ever seeing this one being expressed anywhere, either in sci-fi material or in scholarly articles on innovative space flight technique. Still, I am reluctant to claim the idea as my own wholly original conception. Let me give at least partial credit to U.S. physicist, Robert L. Forward whose Saturn-bound crew (from his 1997 Sci-Fi novel, “Saturn Rukh”) navigated by harpooning small icy bodies, whipping around, then cutting loose, travelling in a new direction without expending rocket fuel. The book had a vibe similar to “A Meeting with Medusa” (my second Arthur C. Clarke allusion in this short essay!)\nThanks for posting your out-of-this-world question on Quora. If you found my response interesting or helpful, please take a moment to up-vote, share with friends, or follow.\n You may enjoy my responses to other cool Quora questions, like the one David asked: [LINKED_TEXT: Rich Angel's answer to What materials are there on Mars that are of value to Earth?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-materials-are-there-on-Mars-that-are-of-value-to-Earth/answer/Rich-Angel-1] .\n Cheers, and Ad Astra!\n"", 'I am going to explain the dynamics of a spin-grav station hopefully in terms it is easy for people to understand, because a lot of people do not have an intuitive grasp of the physics.\n A spin-grav station is not exactly like a regular space station, only spinning. A regular zero-g station has close to zero structural forces placed on it (other than unrelated forces like pressurization, or some rather special case forces like tidal forces which we can ignore). This means that all you need to do to keep the station together is have juuust enough structural integrity to keep the station from floating apart or collapsing under its own minuscule gravity. You could pretty easily build mountain sized zero-g stations with little concern for structural integrity.\n I mean, dental floss and toothpicks may not suffice fora station that big, but even poor quality aluminum girders only kinda-sorta bolted together should work fine.\n Just don’t spin it.\n The moment you start spinning the station all kinds of other forces come into play, and those forces will not play nice with un-engineered structures.\n A spinning station is almost exactly like a bridge, with the span equal to the circumference and the load equal to the gravity created by the spin. Take a rocky asteroid a mile in circumference, hollow it out and spin it up to one G? You now have the equivalent of a mile long rock bridge on the surface of the earth with zero support. That is probably not going to work.\n Even tethering it to itself from the inside (presumably across the diameter) still only gets you the equivalent of a rock suspension bridge a mile long, supported by whatever material your cables are made of. That seems a bit more feasible provided you have a cable every few feet or so, but that is going to play hell with your usable internal space if nothing else.\n And due to the dynamics of floating in space, you do not even get to cheat and build a super crazy mountain scale stone arch bridge. The only bridge types that will work here are tension style bridges. That is, you can only work with spans, you have no piles, pillars, abutments or piers, or anything else that can transfer forces “down” in compression.\n Stone, of any kind, sounds really ill suited to this application, and that is even before we get to the fact that most asteroids are more akin to a pile of gravel than a solid stone mountain.\n What we need are materials that are good under tension, as pretty much every force we are subjecting a spin-grav station to is trying to pull it apart, not squish it together.\n So now that we know all this, does a spin-grav station where an asteroid is the primary structural component still sound like a more feasible idea than an equivalent fully engineered station? This is a test! Answers below.\n', 'Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?\n A fast rotating asteroid is not a good choice for a habitat.\n First, asteroids are generally very, very massive. To get 1G at a rotation rate that doesn’t induce nausea (1 revolution per minute or less), you need a diameter of about 1,800 meters. A spherical asteroid 1,800 meters across made of solid rock would be around 9 billion tons. (Asteroid mass climbs very quickly with if you want a larger asteroids.) It is going to be an epic challenge to get that mass rotating at 1rpm. Meanwhile, an artificial ring station of 1,800m diameter might have a frame of less than 100,000 tons and no more than a few million tons of radiation shielding - and the radiation shielding could be supplied easily by building the space station inside the asteroid.\n Second, asteroids have very poor structural strength. Consider the following two asteroids, Itokawa and Bennu:\n All small asteroids visited by spacecraft so far are piles of dust, gravel, and boulders. Spinning them up to 1G (or even 0.1G) would result in the asteroids flying apart like a cat litter box disassembled with dynamite.\n There is a popular notion of the Cole Habitat, which converts an asteroid into a rotating habitat. A Cole Habitat is made by melting the asteroid with focused sunlight, then inflating it with steam, letting it cool, and then turning the interior into a habitat.\nThe Cole Habitat addresses one problem of converting asteroids into habitats: it consolidates them into a solid mass by melting them. However, asteroids are still very inhomogeneous structures and their re-solidified mass would be a stew of rock slag, metals, carbonaceous materials, and pores from evaporated volatiles. It would never have the strength to carry billions of tons of rotating mass. It would also take a very long time to cool down - a dense blob of billions of tons of molten material in the vacuum of space could take millennia to cool down without a lot of help.\n It would be considerably easier to install a rotating habitat within a non-spinning asteroid than to try to make the asteroid rotating. You get free asteroid shielding, an easy reaction mass against which to spin up the habitat, and lots of material for habitat construction.\n']","[Document(metadata={'top_answers': ['Why don’t humans land in an asteroid or meteor and use it to travel further into space?

Maybe when SpaceX Stahrship flies…\n OK so lets assume a nice big space rock comes by and does such a grazing encounter that slows it enough to MIRACULOUSLY place it in Earth orbit, and looks like its could be used for such a purpose.\n Question #2 How are you going to MOVE that bad boy? We don’t yet have that technology.\n HOWEVER, you are not the first to think of this. An asteroid COULD be placed into an orbit that loops between Earth and Mars on a regular basis. Shuttles would be used at Earth to load outbound passengers and freight and to offload when the asteroid nears Mars, and vice versa. Basically a Hohmann transfer orbit that shifts around the Sun so the asteroid need never be STOPPED at either destination. But that does require SOME maneuverability on that big rock.\n In addition, the shuttles would need some SERIOUS delta V to match velocity. We don’t have anything right now that could do THAT either.\n Edit: look for a sci-fi novel titled “Orbital Resonance” by John Barnes.\n', 'Q: Why don’t humans land in an asteroid or meteor and use it to travel further into space? We could use it to go to places like Mars.\n A couple of points.\nThey are not like buses, running a regular route. While they are in orbits, an asteroid for instance that passes Earth’s orbit is moving about the speed of Earth at that moment. So will only return about 1 per year.To catch and get on the bus, oops asteroid, unlike buses, they don’t stop, they don’t even pause, they just keeping moving along. So a craft that wanted to hitchhike (as it were) would have to match speeds before it could land (land!) and would thus be in the same orbit as the asteroid and going wherever the asteroid was, which makes one wonder that if, if you can match the speed of the asteroid why not just go where you want to go and cut out the middleman?Land! Asteroids have so little mass, that few of them have been able to have their gravity make spheroids of themselves. Their surface gravity is so low that landing is more of a bouncing.\nThere has been serious consideration of establishing (once needed) a shuttle service that could go between Mars and Earth using a controlled swing at each end to reverse the direction and sent the shuttle back the other way.\n', 'Because there’s absolutely no point in doing that.\n In order to land on an object that is going to go somewhere else, you have to give your spacecraft exactly the same velocity as the object you’re planning to land on (otherwise, it would just zip past you and be lost in space, as far as the craft is concerned). And if your spacecraft has that velocity, it would end up where you want to go without having to land on anything.\n Of course, there is one way in which you could be taken somewhere else without having the same velocity, which is to get in front of it and let it smash into you, and instantaneously raise your velocity to the velocity of the object that ran into you. But doing that would destroy your spacecraft and kill you, so it really isn’t a practical way of accomplishing your goal.\n']}, page_content='question: Why don’t humans land in an asteroid or meteor and use it to travel further into space?

Probably only “small sample” returns in the next 25 to 40 years to test technologies to develop better mining extraction methods and see what works best. Not yet economically feasible, and that “yet” part goes well into the future.\n Although there will be a point when it will happen. Specifically,\n As far as “industrial level” asteroid mining that competes with Earth mining of precious metals on a yearly tonnage basis:\n UNLESS YOU HAVE A 200 year LIFE SPAN YOU WON’T SEE THAT !!! NOT THIS CENTURY.\n We cannot yet mine asteroids on even a small testing scale yet. The mechanical tech, the transportation cost, and economies of scale, make it unfeasible for now and into the foreseeable future. For industrial “tonnages” that “equal” and “exceed” mining here on Earth, probably not till the “later part” of the 22nd century; perhaps. Or into the 23rd century. Until Fusion for use in space is fairly widespread, asteroid mining won’t happen on a “big industrial” scale. Human Fusion power and propulsion in space will not happen this century (I’d bet on that) . We will be lucky to get fusion power on Earth for commercial electricity by the end of this century, which would be great, even better and more green than hydro, wind and solar.\n The associated tech to mine is NOT like an I-phone or laptop. Its more “mechanical” and does not advance nearly as fast. Even charged deposition technologies still rely on mechanical machinery which needs testing and development in microgravity, which has not been done yet.\n Also chemical rockets (which is basically all we use, as our ion engine tech is anemic) are really not up to the transportation task of moving mined materials from asteroids. We need multi-megawatt powered Nuclear Electric Propulsion to even begin to make it feasible. Again, that technology does NOT advance as fast as computer tech and your next I-phone iteration does. Your looking at “multiple decades” ahead to develop these things just to working prototype stages, and multiple decades after that for the “real thing” . In the future, it might be possible to move a 100 meter wide asteroid from the asteroid belt to Earth Orbit at 10,000 kilometers or so, and try mining it in Earth orbit. We cannot do that yet.\n Much larger Space Economies of scale would be needed. The estimated cost for Starship is ONLY as advertised IF and only “IF” THOUSANDS of them are built. Ten or 20 or 50 per year will NOT give us the economies of scale needed. the claimsof 2, 4 or 6 million per launch are very (VERY) rosy and optimistic. Only possible if 10,000 were in operation and that’s 2016 dollars.\n It also takes much more than thousands of cheaper heavy lift rockets off Earth’s surface. Again, we need multi-megawatt powered Nuclear Electric Propulsion to even begin to make it feasible. A thousand Starship Heavy’s will not work back and forth to the asteroid belt. It would be like using bicycles to transport a 2,000 pound load per bike from Alaska to Southern Florida. It is more expensive at this point with chemical rockets and the faster propulsion technologies to move 500 and 1000 metric tons at a time are not well enough developed yet. It would literally cost much (much, much) more to just to transport gold, platinum and iridium from the asteroid belt to Earth (excluding the cost to develop to technologies that could actually begin to do it), that the gold, platinum and iridium would be worth on a gram per gram basis.\n Return of Investment would be HIGHLY “very” negative at this point in history. (Plus NOT feasible)\n Current estimated cost per kilogram with today’s technology to Psyche 16 in the asteroid belt and back to Earth with near future Space X Starship Heavy tech transport and mining techniques available near future, I estimate at around 10 million dollars per KG (4,54 million dollars/pound). Or about 10,000 dollars per gram of material. (a small paper clip is about 1.5 grams, so 15,000 dollars per paper clip).\n Dec 2nd 2022\n Platinum is around 30 to 35 dollars per gram.\n Gold (24K) is around 57 to 59 dollars per gram\n iridium is around a 149 dollars per gram,\n So, mining the asteroid belt even for gold would be a HUGE loss on investment at this point in history.\n Current cost to orbit ranges from about 2,500 to 10,000 dollars per pound; The asteroid belt is much, much more expensive, because of the energy required and the hardware to get there and extract materials, then return to Earth. The tech to do that does NOT yet exist.\n What can and should be done in the next 20 years is targeting near Earth asteroids that come in the vicinity of Earth and the moon to test the best ways to extract sample materials from asteroids to test, develop and improve mining extraction technology in microgravity. This will take decades to develop. It’s not like the next I-phone iteration. Long very (LONG) term goals here. Not a normal business model timeline !\n', 'The only ones that have every been ‘mined’ for a resource are the ones that fell to Earth . Meteoric iron had limited use even before the Bronze Age and for a short while after.\n For example the Inuit used parts of the Cape York meteorite to make lance heads and fragments from the Gibeon meteorite were used for centuries by the Nama people of Namibia.

The idea of living on the ceiling of a mined-out area in a rotating asteroid is intriguing because it takes advantage of the asteroid\'s structure and the artificial gravity created by its rotation. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Structural Integrity**: Asteroids aren\'t designed to withstand the kind of stresses that a spinning space station would be. We\'d need to reinforce the structure significantly to prevent it from breaking apart.\n\n2. **Resource Extraction**: Mining out the interior of an asteroid could provide valuable resources for construction and life support systems. That\'s a big plus.\n\n3. **Artificial Gravity**: A fast rotating asteroid could potentially provide Earth-like gravity on the inside surface (or ceiling, from the perspective of someone standing in the asteroid). This would help with health issues related to microgravity.\n\n4. **Construction Effort**: Building a space colony station from scratch would require a massive amount of resources and effort. Using an asteroid as a starting point could potentially reduce this.\n\nHowever, there are also significant challenges:\n\n1. **Uneven Rotation**: Asteroids aren\'t perfectly symmetrical, so spinning one could cause a lot of wobbling and instability.\n\n2. **Life Support**: We\'d need to establish a robust life support system, including atmosphere, water recycling, and food production. This is a complex task regardless of whether you\'re in a space station or an asteroid.\n\n3. **Radiation Shielding**: Asteroids aren\'t necessarily dense enough to provide adequate radiation shielding. We\'d need to address this, possibly by adding additional shielding materials.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea has some merit and could potentially be more feasible in terms of resource use and artificial gravity provision, the structural and safety challenges are significant. It\'s not so much a question of which is more feasible, but rather which challenges we\'re more equipped to tackle with current technology.

From what I’ve managed to learn from Google, marker ink contains little alcohol, it does have other components which might damage the components of a fountain pen. For the most part, marker ink is oil based while fountain pen ink is water based. Even if the marker ink doesn’t gum up the pen itself by melting it, the ink’s viscosity might not allow it to flow through the pen.\n Years ago, I was traveling and ran out of fountain pen ink. I managed to find a bottle of stamp pad ink in the office where I was working. It looked just like fountain pen ink, but it ended up ruining one of my pens. Fortunately, it was an inexpensive Pilot Varsity (which was “disposable” anyway).\n Second of all, there are probably thousands of different kinds of fountain pen inks so there’s little reason to use inks not specifically meant for fountain pens.\n', 'I would only put ink intended for fountain pens in fountain pens.\n Marker ink is formulated for use in felt tipped or porous tipped marking pens.

Or are the odds so low that someone buying 1 ticket has the same chance essentially?,"['Let’s look at the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot, which is probably the most famous lottery game in the United States and worldwide. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338, for every $2 ticket you buy. I suppose that if you were to buy 2 tickets, your odds are now “only” 1 in 146,100,669 - and you’re now out $4. But buying more tickets doesn’t really enhance your odds in a way that helps you, since you’re out $2 for every ticket you buy.\n So how could you really beat the odds?\n The only way you could be guaranteed to win the jackpot is to buy 292,201,338 tickets (that’s the number of possible number combinations), and make sure that each of those 292,201,338 tickets have a unique number. To do that, you’ll need to spend $584,402,676 to buy tickets, since you’re buying 292,201,338 tickets at $2 each.\n Of course, there’s no way you personally can buy more than $584 million worth of lottery tickets at your local 7-Eleven. Even if they had that many tickets available, there’s no way they could print 292+ million tickets before the next jackpot drawing, and their printer would probably break before that could happen. You’re better off hiring people to buy those tickets for you scattered in many cities. That’s probably going to cost you tens of millions of dollars more, conservatively.\n How many people would you need to hire just to buy the tickets? If each person can somehow buy 1,000 tickets, then you’ll need to hire 292,201 people to do it. You’ll also need to hire people to oversee the operation, since you can’t oversee 292,201 people all by yourself. You’ll also need to make sure they’re all trustworthy enough to be handed $2,000 in cash to each buy 1,000 tickets for you with the right number combination. Just one rogue worker who keeps the cash, buys the wrong tickets or decides to keep the winning ticket for themselves can ruin the whole operation.\n Even if everyone you hire is honest and does the work they promise to do, you’ll also need to make sure the cash value of the Powerball jackpot is well north of $584 million. The price they advertise as the “jackpot” is always lower than the 30-year annuity they advertise as the “jakpot.” With more than $600 million worth of expenses so far, 30 years is too long to wait for payment.\n And even if you can somehow get the logistics, it’s just not that often where the Powerball gets high enough.

The difference compared to playing just one ticket is dependent on the game format, however.\n The chance of winning or odds of winning or probability for winning is dependent on two fundamental factors: favorable cases (f) and total possible cases (N). Mathematically, the most common expression of probability/chance (P) for winning is:\n P = f / N\n The simplest case: coin tossing. For example, the chance for winning heads: 1 / 2 = 0.5 = 50%. That is –\n 1 “heads” (favorable cases)\n 2 “sides” (total possible cases).\n In lottery, the favorable cases are represented by the number of tickets played.\n I work out one of the most popular lotto game formats: 6 winning numbers from a field of 49.

It’s the mathematical expectation of what the average person will get for each dollar they spend on lottery tickets. That’s the sum of all possible prizes multiplied by the probability of winning each prize.\n For every lottery out there, the expectation is negative. For every dollar you spend, you (everyone on average, including the jackpot winners) might get back $0.25 to $0.50.

ساتھ اپنی دوسری مسلسل فتح حاصل کی۔ اس فتح نے انہیں ویسٹرن کانفرنس میں ساتویں نمبر پر پہنچا دیا، جو کہ گولڈن اسٹیٹ واریئرز سے فائنل میں پلے ان ٹورنامنٹ سے بچنے کے لیے صرف 1.5 گیمز پیچھے ہے۔ ناز ریڈ نے شاندار 73.3% شوٹنگ پر 26 پوائنٹس حاصل کرتے ہوئے ٹمبر وولز کے لیے اسکورنگ چارج کی قیادت کی۔ دیگر اہم شراکت داروں میں جیڈن میک ڈینیئلز، کارل-انتھونی ٹاؤنز، ٹورین پرنس اور مائیک کونلی شامل تھے، جن میں سے سبھی نے 10+ پوائنٹس حاصل کیے۔ جبکہ\n Timberwolves -3.5-پوائنٹس کے اسپریڈ کو پورا کرنے میں ناکام رہے، گیم میں حاصل کیے گئے 249 مشترکہ پوائنٹس نے آرام سے 242 پوائنٹس کے پری گیم مارک کو پیچھے چھوڑ دیا۔\n

اپنے حالیہ کھیلوں کی اکثریت میں، اس نے پوائنٹس اور اسسٹ کے لیے اوور مارا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، اس کے آخری پانچ گیمز میں، اس کے پاس فی گیم کم از کم 35 پوائنٹس اور اسسٹس ہیں، جو o34.5 لائن سے زیادہ ہے۔ مزید برآں، کری حال ہی میں اچھا کھیل رہا ہے، اس نے اپنے آخری دس گیمز میں سے چھ میں کم از کم 30 پوائنٹس اسکور کیے، جس سے اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ وہ اس بیٹنگ لائن پر اوور کرنے کے لیے کافی اسکور کر سکتا ہے۔ لہذا، پوائنٹس اور اسسٹ کے لیے اوور پر بیٹنگ o34.5 (-115) پر حالیہ ڈیٹا کی بنیاد پر بہترین شرط ہوگی۔\n Klay Thompson کے لیے، ہماری بہترین شرط 21.5 سے زیادہ پوائنٹس ہوں گے جو -125 مشکلات پر اسکور کیے گئے ہوں۔ کلے کا سیزن اوسطاً 21.78 پوائنٹس فی گیم ہے، اور اس نے اپنے آخری دس گیمز میں سے چھ میں 22.5 پوائنٹس سے زیادہ اسکور کیے ہیں، آخری دس میں فی گیم 20.0 پوائنٹس کی اوسط کے ساتھ۔ اس سے پتہ چلتا ہے کہ وہ اپنے آنے والے مخالفین کے خلاف 21.5 پوائنٹس سے زیادہ سکور کر سکتا ہے، خاص طور پر ان کی حالیہ کارکردگی کو دیکھتے ہوئے. جبکہ 26.5 سے زیادہ پوائنٹس اور -115 مشکلات پر ری باؤنڈز بھی ایک اچھی شرط ہو سکتی ہے، Klay کی حالیہ ری باؤنڈنگ اوسط 3.8 فی گیم کافی کم ہے، جس سے اس پر شرط لگانا کم قابل اعتماد ہے۔ اسی طرح، -145 اوڈز پر بنائے گئے 3.5 سے زیادہ تھری پوائنٹرز ایک پرکشش آپشن ہو سکتے ہیں، لیکن Klay کی فی گیم 3.8 کی حالیہ اوسط لائن سے کوئی خاص فرق نہیں ہے، جو اسے کم سازگار شرط بناتی ہے۔ لہذا، کلے تھامسن پر 21.5 سے زیادہ پوائنٹس حاصل کرنا بہترین شرط ہے۔\n جہاں تک روڈی گوبرٹ کا تعلق ہے، وہ اس سیزن میں اوسطاً 11.5 ریباؤنڈز لے رہے ہیں اور اپنے آخری چار مقابلوں میں سے تین میں کم از کم 12 ریباؤنڈز حاصل کر چکے ہیں۔ کارل انتھونی ٹاؤنز کے ساتھ آج رات کے واریئرز کے مقابلے کے لیے مشکوک ہونے کے ساتھ،

have to be dedicated, so it’s a good idea to have a special account that’s only for placing bets.\n When you open this account, be sure you invest enough money to cover your bankroll for an entire season or year, not just a single game.\n To ensure you have enough money, multiply your base bet by at least 100, and that’s the minimum amount you should keep in this account at all times.\n If you\'re new to sports betting and don’t know your base bet, put in whatever money you have set aside for this venture and determine your base bet on the size of your bankroll (each bet should represent one to two percent).\n 2. Create accounts with a few sportsbooks.\nIn order to place bets, you have to have an account with at least one sportsbook, though it’s ideal to have at least three, because then you can compare offerings and place smarter bets. Some sportsbooks also offer signup bonuses, so be sure to shop around. Most sportsbooks are available online these days, and some of the more popular sites include:\n Bookmaker\n Bovada\n Betonline\n 3. Learn to make smart bets.\nThere are a number of rules that apply to this, and while some are about the numbers, others are about which teams you should and shouldn’t bet on.\n For instance, while each bet should represent about one to two percent of your bankroll, you can reduce this to 0.5 percent if you aren\'t confident about a bet. Similarly, you can increase the bet if you\'re very confident, but never place a bet that exceeds four percent of your bankroll.\n There are also some experts who say never to place a bet if you aren\'t confident, because it’s better to walk away and find a better bet that you feel good about.\n Many experts recommend not betting on your home team in any sport, because your bias can cloud your judgement, and this can lead to great losses.\n 4. Create a betting schedule.\nDon’t just bet on every game: every week, look at the upcoming games and pick the ones you want to bet on based on your confidence in the potential bet.\n Don’t be afraid to walk away from a bet right before the game. Odds change, lines change, and point spreads change, and if you\'re no longer confident about a bet, either don’t make it or reduce the bet.\n 5. Don’t chase bad bets.\nThis refers to the practice of trying to recoup losses from a previous bet with more betting. It’s dangerous to do this because many people will set aside good judgement and place more bad bets in an attempt to win back what was lost, and this results in further losses.\n The opposite is also true: don’t chase a good bet (one where you won) with more bets in an attempt to win more or double your money. Have a betting schedule or routine and stick to it.\n 6. Bet sober.\nThis refers to betting with a clear mind and focus. Many people will read this and think it is common sense but you would be surprised how many people break this rule. Emotions can get the best of all of us, and bad decisions can be made from those emotions.\n ""Going on Tilt"" was a term developed when sports bettors let their emotions cloud their best resulting in losing their bankroll.\n Part 2 of 3:Understanding Sports Betting1. Understand moneylines.\nThe moneyline is a plus or minus number associated with each team involved in a particular match, and it refers to either how much you have to bet to win $100 or how much you\'ll win if you bet $100.\n For instance, if a moneyline is Toronto Maple Leafs -200 and Vancouver Canucks +155, it means you have to bet $200 on the Leafs in order to win $100, or you have to bet $100 on the Canucks to win $155.\n The team associated with the minus number (the Leafs) is the favored team, while the team associated with the plus number (the Canucks) is the underdog.\n Many gamblers bet on the moneyline in hockey and baseball, because the scores are lower and point spread betting doesn’t make as much sense in these games. However, you can bet on the moneyline for almost every sport.\n 2. Learn about point spreads.\nPoint spread betting is more popular in games where there\'s a larger gap between the final scores. In a point spread bet, you don’t just bet on whether a team will win, but also whether that team will win by a specific amount.\n For instance, if a point spread is Detroit Lions +4, New England Patriots -4, you would bet on whether you thought the Lions would win and if they\'d win by more than four points.\n Again, the team associated with the minus is the favorite and the team associated with the plus is the underdog.\n 3. Understand parlays.\nParlay betting involves making multiple types of bets on the same game. For example, if you combined a moneyline bet and a point spread bet on the same game, this would be a parlay bet.\n These bets often offer large payouts, but they require a great deal of accuracy.\n Part 3 of 3:Learning Betting Strategy1. Shop for the best lines.\nThis is where having accounts with multiple sportsbooks will come in handy, because some will offer better moneylines on the same games, meaning you have to risk less for the chance to win the same amount of money.\n The best time to line shop is about an hour before a game.\n To get the best value, consider opening accounts with at least three books.\n 2. Make bets based on the odds.\nBetting with your head instead of your heart is all about making smart bets based on odds rather than emotions. Sometimes it’s a good idea to bet on the numbers rather than who you think will win, because this can represent a better value if the odds are in your favor.\n For instance, if you\'re betting on a baseball game and think the Yankees are going to win, you might still be better off placing your bet on the Jays if the odds are right.\n 3. Don’t be afraid to bet on the underdog.\nThis doesn’t mean betting on a long shot, but rather betting on the underdog when the odds are right. Sometimes, the favored team is chosen based on popularity rather than skill, so it doesn’t necessarily mean the favorite will win.\n 4. Take advantage of matched betting.\nMatched betting involves taking advantage of the bonuses and incentives offered by books to place bets for and against the exact same event.\n For instance, in a basketball game between the Raptors and the Knicks, you would place a bet for the Raptors and then match that same bet against the Raptors.\n Matched betting is all about taking advantage of free bets and betting for both possible outcomes on the same game, so this type of betting is as near to risk-free as you can get in gambling.\n', 'The proliferation of legal sports betting has introduced millions to a hobby that can be costly. Many new players discover that beating the house is not easy. But it’s not unrealistic at least to give yourself a better chance. Taking a look at the habits and tools used by sharp bettors — also known as “sharps,” “professionals” or “wiseguys” — gives us clues as to how professionals sustain a track record of success.\nHere are six things you can do to give yourself a fighting chance against the house.\n 1. Know your bet’s break-even rate\n The break-even rate is, quite simply, the rate you would need to win a given bet to break even over the long term. Your edge over the house appears when the odds are more forgiving than your bet’s break-even rate. The bigger the difference, the higher your edge.\n To start, let’s consider a simple coin flip. The win rate for betting on the outcome is 50 percent: Half the time we would expect the coin to land on heads, with the other half on tails. In sports betting terms, the fair moneyline equivalent for such a bet would be +100: Bet $100 to win $100. Wagering on a moneyline better than +100 — which would provide a break-even rate of less than 50 percent — would turn the coin flip bet into a winning proposition over time because the 50-50 odds are above the break-even rate. Odds worse than +100 would carry a break-even rate above 50 percent and would be expected to reduce your bankroll. For [LINKED_TEXT: using sports betting strategies] [URL: https://betzillion.com/strategies/] go here.\n 2. Shop around for the best price\n You wouldn’t buy a car without comparing prices, and you should take the same approach to sports betting. This is harder to do at brick-and-mortar sportsbooks — or in jurisdictions that limit your mobile betting options — but as long as you have multiple shops, you are giving away money if you don’t compare prices.\n This process, also known as line shopping, is an underrated exercise that many sharp bettors consider a crucial part of their success.\n “Line shopping is the single sharpest thing you can do to advance your sports betting game,” explained Jack Andrews, a professional bettor and co-founder of Unabated, a website that offers line comparison calculators and other tools geared toward educating the betting community. “When you line shop, you are looking for the lowest vig: -105 compared to -110, for example. And you will lose less when you are wrong if you pay less vig.”\n 3. Know the value of a half-point, especially in NFL betting\n Football scoring — three points for field goals, six points for touchdowns, seven for touchdowns with the extra point — causes final margins to clump around the key numbers of 3 and 7 first and foremost, followed by 6, 14 and 10.\n Use this to your advantage. However, you need to know how much a half-point is worth when a point spread goes from, say, -3 to -2½, turning a potential push into a win for a three-point favorite. Ditto when it goes from +3 to +3½, turning a potential push into a win for a three-point underdog. The value of that half-point, confusingly, isn’t the same as the half-point difference between -7 and -6½, or +7 and +7½, which could turn pushes into wins in a seven-point game.\n 4. Avoid parlays, especially single-game parlays\n Parlays provide a huge windfall for the house. In May, Louisiana reported $12.4 million in income off parlays alone, which accounted for more than 48 percent of its total profit. According to UNLV’s Center for Gaming Research, the state’s oddsmakers earn, on average, 32.1 cents per dollar wagered on parlays, compared with just 5 cents per dollar on straight wagers. Think of parlays as high-interest credit cards: Simply avoiding them entirely will be an immediate boost to your bottom line.\n The reason they’re so good for books — and bad for players — is twofold: They are difficult to win, and the odds offered in single-game parlays sometimes differ substantially from their straight wager counterparts. The latter is especially true if the wagers are correlated, meaning one could influence the other’s chances of occurring. For example, a parlay featuring a player hitting a home run plus the total number of runs going over is correlated, because home runs by nature increase the score. That parlay will pay less than if you parlayed the same player hitting a home run with the total going under, even if the over/under bets were the same at the same price.\n 5. Place your bets early in the week, not at the last minute\n All markets start with an opening line, the first one available for wagering. These typically have lower limits than lines available closer to game time, an attempt to limit the house’s exposure. After all, the opening lines are only a first guess as to what the appropriate market should be. As more information is collected — player moves, starting lineups, injury reports, sharp action — the prices are moved and the limits are raised. By game time, conventional wisdom and betting action have given us a mature market — and often inferior prices relative to what was available earlier.\n In football, try to focus your wagering on opening lines, including look-ahead lines released a week early. In 2021, there were 32 instances of an NFL favorite opening at -2½, a key number discussed above. That price improved 19 times and stayed the same 10 times, leaving us with just three instances in which the opening line got worse. An opening line of -6½ improved seven out of 12 times in 2021. It’s a fine strategy to blindly bet any opening or look-ahead line at those numbers, provided the price is -110 or better.\n 6. Focus on closing line value\n Winning a bet is great, but it’s not the only — or even the best — measure of success. Think about playing poker; you might lose after going all-in with a pair of aces against a pair of 3s, but that doesn’t mean your bet was unwise.\n In sports betting, the equivalent focus should be on closing line value: the price of your bet relative to where the line closes at a sharp book after removing the vig. There are plenty of no-vig calculators online; just make sure the book you are comparing your wager with is one known to take sharp action (such as Pinnacle or Circa). For example, if you bet the Kansas City Chiefs moneyline at -160 and it closes at -200 after removing the vig, you have closing line value — a better price than bettors were offered at the last possible instant. If the no-vig closing line was -140, then the market is telling you your price is not as good.\n']}, page_content='question: What is the formula for sport betting?'), Document(metadata={'top_answers': ['Mr. Gerber identifies the key vulnerability in earning either credit card points or miles … their redemption value is subject to revision and isn’t firmly fixed. So I’d suggest that there isn’t a definitive answer to your question. At any given time, points could be worth more than miles, or vice versa.\n There is, however, a general convention in which a credit card point can be redeemed for $.01 in cashback or statement credit, and a credit card mile can be redeemed for a $.01 credit against airline charges posted to your card.\n Within this strict confine, the value of each is equivalent.\n But, going back to Gerber’s point, he identifies exactly why I typically avoid cards with either point or mile reward accrual. Instead, I largely stick with cards that earn a fixed stated $ reward (not points), or ones that award airline mileage with a specific airline.\n In the latter case, airline cards (such as Barclay’s Aviator — Amer Air), still present the vulnerability that the miles necessary to issue a given reward ticket can change. However, at least this is a vulnerability that I’ve already assumed in choosing to participate in that frequent flyer award program.\n Under this scenario, a limited amount of math is necessary to optimally allocate my personal expenses across my credit cards. Take the following 3 cards in my wallet:\n Citi Double Cash: 2% cash rebate against all charges\n Citi Professional: 1% general cash rebate, 3% on dining/travel/office supplies (I’ve simplified a tad here)\n Barclays Aviator Silver: $95 fee … only used for American Air charges, on which I’m awarded 3 AAdvantage (frequent flyer program) miles. Given my redemption experience over time, I’m confident of securing $.014 value for each AA mile I redeem.\n It should be clear that in this case, I hold 1 AA mile to be equivalent to $.014 cashback from the other two cards.\n In my personal credit card spend, I’m going to favor the Citi Prof for the 3% earn categories, the Aviator for American Airlines purchases, and the Double Cash for all other credit card expenditures.\n So one postscript: I actually actively use Chase Sapphire Reserve for all my dining and travel spend now (rather than Citi Prof). It’s a points-based card.\n Now that goes directly against my stated preference to avoid cards that award “points”. I’ve made an exception in this case because, even with a hefty annual fee, my annual spend on those categories yields very hefty reward credits …\n The card grants a 3% point reward on those categories. Further, when you redeem the point value (1 pt = $.01) towards travel booked on their designated booking site (very similar to Expedia, etc.), they boost the amount credited from redemption of points by 50%. In other words, the ultimate rebate earned on dining/travel spend is 4.5%.\n Since I actively redeem accrued points by booking travel through their portal, I’ve limited my risk to a revision to point value. Chase Sapphire Reserve had yielded the strongest reward benefits of any card I’ve ever held, even after netting out the annual fee.\n', ""Whether credit card points or miles are worth more depends on your preferences and how you plan to use them.\n Points are generally more flexible than miles, and can be redeemed for various rewards like gift cards, merchandise, or statement credits. Points also tend to have a higher value per redemption than miles.\n On the other hand, miles are more useful for frequent travellers, as they can be redeemed for flights, hotel stays, and other travel-related expenses. Miles may also offer higher redemption value than points when used for travel.\n Ultimately, the worth of credit card rewards depends on how you plan to use them. If you're not a frequent traveller, points may be a better option for their flexibility and higher redemption value. However, if you travel frequently, miles may be more valuable to you because they can offset travel expenses.\n Calculate your expenses in one go through Fi to determine whether credit card points or credit card miles are the better options for you.

Each lottery ticket has an independent chance of winning, so buying more tickets doesn\'t change the odds per ticket, it just gives you more attempts.\n\nFor example, if the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 300 million (as is the case with many major lotteries), buying 100 tickets would make your odds 100 in 300 million, which is still extremely low.

impossible, quite a few amateur chemists, self taught, no formal education or professional experience, have managed to do so, often without having to buy any or very little watch list chemicals, making all most of reagents/precursors from widely available sources like paint thinners, drain cleaner, essential oils, RC fuel, pool chemicals etc\n it requires an in depth knowledge for organic chemistry, lots of time, patience and PRACTICE/experience to pull something like synthesizing MDMA, a multi step process that spans many hours, more if you have to make many of the key compounds from scratch.\n For those who think it will like be how meth heads make meth via “shake and bake”, it’s not even close.\n MDMA synthesis requires legit chemistry equipment, borosilicate boiling flasks mixing glasses separation funnel addition funnel, hot plate or mantle w fast stirring, reflux condenser, aspirator strong water pump for vacuum distillation, all the little distillation kit accessories clips stands lab jack etc\n all of that just to start, which decent quality can run you at least $2–3k, unless you can find some used glassware.\n It would be wise to make an attempt to get as much of this locally with cash as possible, but if you buy it online, maybe try eBay for used stuff, but there are plenty good science supply shops, I’d just order this online way before buying any chemicals, as you don’t want to alert too much attention.\n Sounds crazy but internet surveillance is real.\n Then after you’ve got your lab ware stuff, which is the easiest stuff to find in this synthesis, you’ve got you’re precursors, solvents, secondary compounds for cleaning product up, work up etc\n Main precursor is Safrole, a root beer smelling liquid which must be distilled, preferably vacuum distilled from Sassafras Root essential oil, but also Brown camphor oil can be used.\n It’s not hard to find either, but again, the DEA knows these are precursor rich raw materials for illicit MDMA production, so don’t go buying up gallons online.\n Once safrole is distilled from the raw essential oil, it must be further processed into Isosafrole, an isomer of safrole, where the double bond of the alkene is moved from the terminal, to the inner part of the molecule, via refluxing safrole with a little KOH, under reduced pressure.\n So as you can see, some of the chemicals in the process of making MDMA, cannot always be bought but must be synthesized, making the acquisition much more time consuming and potentially riskier than just purchasing it.\n Isosafrole, after purification, is them reacted with either oxone, or a solution of Peracetic acid, which generates a glycol, of which is extracted and then hydrolyzed using muriatic acid, and that gives us the direct precursor of MDMA, the ketone MDP2P\n oxone can be bought from pool supply stores, and peracetic solution is made from glacial acetic acid and a 35% solution of H2O2, which can be difficult to find and some states, but can be found at certain “natural health” sort of stores.\n Also can be made from 3% h2o2, but takes a lot.\n Final stage is the actual synthesis of MDMA itself, which is reacted with methylamine, produced in situ using Nitromethane sourced from RC fuel, forming an imine which is reduced into MDMA by a Hg/Al amalgam, formed by small pieces of Al foil in a solution containing HgCl2.\n Mercuric chloride can be bought online easy, and since rather little is used the reaction, even on reasonably good size scales, one doesn’t have to buy it too often.\n Don’t buy too much though, as it on the DEA Special Surveillance list, the least regulated tier compared to List I and List II, which most precursors fall under, as well many key compounds often used in clandestine chemistry.\n Reynolds brand of aluminum is fine, the extra heavy duty one.\n Solvent used in the initial reflux period is methanol, which is not hard to get, can be distilled from certain paint thinners or just bought outright, and then toluene as extraction solvent, also can be distilled from paint thinners.\n NaOH is used to basify the reaction solution once it is finished, and it is very easy to buy, also can be bought as red devil lye.\n After separation, extraction w toluene and work up, drying of the non polar mdma rich solvent, it can then be gassed using an HCL generator to create the salt MDMA hcl.\n In summary, here’s a list of everything:\n Safrole->Isosafrole\n KOH\n Isosafrole->Glycol\n Oxone, or Peracetic acid solution using GAA and 35% H2o2.\n Glycol->ketone mdp2p\n muriatic acid, methanol, DCM, NaOH\n MDP2P->MDMA\n HgCl2\n nitromethane\n Al foil\n methanol\n toluene or dcm, NaOH\n With exception to the ketone, all of these can be fairly easily acquired, mostly can be from local stores but a few will likely have to be found online.\n', 'Hard.\n And getting the chemicals is nothing on getting hold of the lab equipment and space, and getting the requisite skill in organic chemistry.\n MDMA synthesis is a fiddly process that’s extremely unforgiving of mistakes. One of the most common synthesis pathways involves using mercury salts(!) and produces elemental mercury in the waste stream. It’s a 22-hour-long synthesis that requires lots of persnickety babysitting. If you lack the proper equipment (including a fume hood and distillation column) and experience, you’ll spend a ton of money and time, produce toxic waste products, and end up with nothing to show for it.\n I looked at the process online and was like “oh hell no.”\n', 'Here’s a start to finish guide for you:\n [LINKED_TEXT: http://files.shroomery.org/cms/5884398-Complete_MDMA_synthese.pdf] [URL: http://files.shroomery.org/cms/5884398-Complete_MDMA_synthese.pdf]\n As you will probably conclude, getting hold of actual MDMA is a lot easier than getting hold of the chemicals, equipment and knowledge used to make it.\n']}, page_content='question: How hard is it to acquire the chemicals needed to make MDMA?'), Document(metadata={'top_answers': ['I pride myself on being able to handle hot/spicy food.

But I was not even close to prepared for what I encountered in North Dakota a handful of years ago.\n The hottest food I have ever had was at Parrot Cay in Grand Forks, North Dakota. I love hot/spicy food. I like my nose to run while I’m eating, lol. Anyway, this place has a heat scale on their menu that ranges up to 40. I asked for jambalaya and wanted the level 40 just to see how bad it was. The bartender tried to talk me out of it. She kept telling me I didn’t want it, but I insisted that I did. She said there were only a few regular customers that could handle it, and they had worked their way up to it. Again, I insisted. She gave in. I soon regretted not listening to her. The pain was almost instant. I took a couple more bites and suddenly I was overwhelmed. I pushed the bowl away, I was rocking back and forth on my stool, suckin air, and drinkin my beer in between breaths. My eyes were uncontrollably watering, tears streaming down my face. I was almost in a state of panic. The bartender walked by and smiled while shaking her head. “I told you” she said, lol.\n Apparently the sauce they make is a concoction using ghost peppers, habaneros, Carolina Reapers, and I don’t know what all. But they told me the heat is in the neighborhood of 7 million scoville units. The Carolina Reaper is the current heaveyweight champ with an individual pepper coming in at 2.2 million scoville heat units. (Google research)\n While I was licking my wounds and suckin down that cold beer, a small group of people across the room started to cheer. I could see a man with his arms raised so I asked what was going on. Apparently they have a wing challenge there with wings basted in that incredibly hot sauce. A guy had just did the challenge.

I was at a street food festival in my town about 10 years ago with my young son (then aged around six), which featured a chilli stall, with an array of about twenty chilli sauces in little pots with small cubes of bread on the side to dip and taste. They were clearly labelled, left to right, as mild to lethal. Being rather partial to chilli, I was browsing the exotic range of sauces, when I was distracted by an acquaintance who had stopped for a chat. When he left, I returned to the stall and… started accidentally from the wrong end, taking a large dollop of the “lethal” sauce. My head exploded. I was left breathless, coughing and spluttering, and in considerable pain. I remember grabbing my son’s ice-cream and cramming it into my face. The effect subsided after about ten minutes, and I bought my son - who seemed unsure whether to be appalled or amused at the strange antics of his dad - another ice-cream.\n He still remembers it too - last year, for my birthday, he bought me a bottle of something called “Mad Dog Inferno”.

I forget what Scoville rating it had, but I’d been warned to consume it with caution. Good thing I followed that advice and tasted a drop of it first without glugging it down. It felt like an oxyacetylene flame on my tongue.\n Some years later I swallowed a capsaicin capsule rated at 200,000 SHU, an extract strong enough to peel paint off a ship’s hull. I was fine for a moment, and then I felt it—not a burning sensation, but more like being slugged in the gut, followed by feelings of nausea.\n That passed in a minute or two, and I learned to take those capsules with a hunk of bread and some water.

A number of the people present are there to have their professional lives massively improved by a moment of concentrated approval and applause, and leading up to that moment, during the time when so many people there are in the running for that big positive kick from the Academy, the Academy toys with them a bit by hiring a comedian to make fun of as many of them as he (have there been any women?) possibly can in the time he has.\n Every single person there knows that if they’re famous to the public they’re subject to being roasted, that is, sarcastically made fun of, and Jada Pinkett and Will certainly fit in that category, and had every reason to expect to be made fun of.\n Whether people enjoy it or not, one has to consider that it is an honor, because little known people aren’t teased, only very famous ones.\n Jada doesn’t have some medical condition, unless you consider ever person in the country who has thinning or thin hair to be sick, which would make every man with male pattern baldness and every woman with hair loss during menopause, which is most, to be sick. Jada has been putting intense pressure on her hair for hears, if you look at her hairstyles, they are a high-tension war between competing rows of hair; that’s why she had previous described herself as suffering from traction alopecia, something that is self-induced. And the word “alopecia”, which the media suddenly decided to describe as a “medical condition”? It simply means thinning hair, which occurs for most Americans by her age.\n Jada, who isn’t known for anything other than harassing and tormenting her poor cuckold husband in his home and by having sex with his children’s friends and making sure everyone knows it who possibly could, has decided that her celebrity cause is her own hair. So she shaved her head, something she doesn’t have to do, and the only obvious bit of hair loss is a very thin line that looks like she had a procedure of some kind, like scalp reduction, but other than that, she has lots of healthy hair follicles all over her head, as visible as will’s shame each time he’s made one of his insincere apologies one of his “people” have insisted that he further embarrass himself with.\n There was absolutely nothing for Will to react to or respond to. All he did was destroy his career for good. Would I have done the same thing to Chris Rock? You mean would I have taken over the entire Oscars ceremony on live national TV, committed a criminal act of violence, and then pimp-walked off with confidence and pride before returning to my seat so I could yell more pimp-culture nonsense at a man doing his job by comparing my wife, a woman who made a big announcement just before the Oscars that she didn’t care what anyone said about her hair—an invitation if ever there was one to freely make comments about her celebrity cause she can’t stop talking about?\n No. And if I were there and that a-hole still got his award, I wouldn’t have stood up and clapped for him either. I would have stayed in my seat and waved my first finger back and forth in disapproval and hoped I ended up being shown on the broadcast as the only person in the room with any character or courage, but there were no such people there that night.\n Will Smith is finished, for good, and Jada is hated as well.

I’m using this answer to call you guys out.\n Anyone who defends Will Smith or Jada is a joke.\n Chris Rock’s job is to be a comedian. He’s meant to make comedy and jokes out of things, places, events, and people. That includes Jada. She’s not immune to a joke.\n And here’s the thing. If you actually look at the footage, you can clearly see Will Smith laughing along with the joke. It’s until Jada gives the stink eye that Will reacts.\n With the recent videos that have been resurfaced, it’s not surprising. Jada mentally abused Will Smith. That’s no secret. She decides to have a relationship with a rapper who’s friends with her son… yeah… and then the video of Will Smith basically begging Jada to stop is just another sign of that. The only reason he stays with her is because he does believe in multiple chances and wants to stay faithful. It’s not bad, but if I were in his shoes, I would divorce her immediately. Anybody who acts like Jada should not be in a relationship. Simple as that.\n Will Smith’s break down in the Oscars reflects that. It’s sad, but even that doesn’t excuse him from anything. So making the excuse that “he was simply defending his wife” is a pathetic cover up. And it’s a cover up in the guise of righteousness covering up the fact that people like [LINKED_TEXT: Carla Turner] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Carla-Turner-50] and [LINKED_TEXT: Laurie S Billton] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Laurie-S-Billton] and other like them want heavier regulations on speech and are trying to dissolve the sphere of comedy to do so.\n Reason? Just so that they don’t have to deal with opposing opinions. Simple as that. Don’t believe me? Look at their comment sections. Oh yeah, they disabled them. It shows that they know what their intentions are and that deep down, they know Will Smith was in the wrong.\n It would’ve made sense if Chris Rock came up to them in the street and started teasing and poking fun at Jada for no reason. But he’s on stage now. He’s in his profession. And he’s going to make jokes. If you can’t take a joke, live with it. But it most certainly does not excuse one of walking up and slapping said comedian. Just look at all the things comedians joke about. Do you honestly think some dude’s wife, who’s the wife of a person they know very well, should be exempt from jokes at all? People don’t understand the point of comedy. It’s purpose is to poke fun at literally everything. If you don’t like that, then don’t watch it. That choice is entirely up to you.\n But it certainly does not excuse any violence ones commits. And it most certainly does not excuse the want to regulate speech at all fronts, including the sphere of comedy, like [LINKED_TEXT: Laurie S Billton] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Laurie-S-Billton] or [LINKED_TEXT: Carla Turner] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Carla-Turner-50] or others like them want.\n', ""For me personally?

I think he is a good guy.\n Just made a horrible mistake. And he is paying the price for it.\n I think he should take a long look at who he is married too. Because even though I don`t need to speculate on other`s personal affairs, you can see Jada is toxic and is the one pulling Will Smith`s strings.\n But he is a grown man.\n He has to do what is right for him.\n I know what I would do.\n Leave.\n Lol.\n Take this as a wise life lesson fellas:\n Don`t ever fight for anyone that does not respect you.\n Real talk.\n Yes stick up for your women when she is loyal, kind, strong, and has your back.

I`m no tough guy by any stretch, but until I started fighting back and sticking up for myself more in life, I saw exactly why people did not show me respect.

It hurts your love ones, your kids lose respect for you, and all the hard work you have done in your life for 30 plus years is now just remembered as “ the guy that took a slap from Will Smith “\n So believe me, even though Will has gone through alot of backlash, Chris is the one that still got hit and embarrassed.\n Think about it.\n It`s been a year since that happened.\n And it is still shown alot.\n You can even see his own peers laughing at it.\nDamn that has to sting.\n Especially when you are supposed friends with these people. I know how comedians are. They are going to joke.\n But do you want to be the punchline to every joke?\n I don`t think so.\n And another thing:\n It will never go away.\n Chris will always have to live with that humiliation forever.\n Might sound harsh but it will be hard to get jobs as a actor like he did in “ Fargo “ playing a gangster.\n How can you play a gangster when everyone see`s you get treated like that? You will not be able to sell that illusion. And dating? Shit… woman can be brutal. You think a women would not pop their mouth if Chris raised his voice at them after seeing that? Probably say some shit about getting Will to slap him again.\n Cruel world. But that is how it is.\n Hopefully Chris does what I did.\n Destroy all that weak shit inside you.\n Find that inner strength you always had.\n And rebuild yourself from the ground up.\n Takes time.

Will saw a chance to hit someone that would not fight back. And Chris was that person.\n So Will obviously needs to learn how to control himself better and not be manipulative.\n Stop picking easy targets as well to lash out at.\n And Chris has to learn to stand up for himself.\n Plain and simple.\n Safe to say this.. this will be a incident that is in pop culture now. I know Chris got 20 million for “ Selective Outrage “\n But was the money worth going through this Chris?\n I don`t think so.\n So not only does Will have some inner soul searching to do,\n Chris does as well too.\n And that is real shit.\n Thanks for reading.\n Take care.\n Peace.\n O.J.\n Bonus: Article, clip and discussion of the Will Smith slap to Chris Rock.\n[LINKED_TEXT: ‘To hide the coward’: how Will Smith’s personal history may explain his Oscars violenceThe actor, who hit Chris Rock at the Oscars for joking about his wife, has written publicly about his need to compensate for a childhood marred by domestic violencehttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/will-smith-abusive-childhood-chris-rock-oscars] [URL: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/will-smith-abusive-childhood-chris-rock-oscars] ', 'Q: “Why did Will Smith just slap Chris Rock at the Oscars?”\n … There is a fundamental reason why this happened, and why you see the same thing happening all around the world. It’s a reason that nobody wants to consider, and the reason why humanity now stands on the precipice of self-destruction, … and the clock is ticking!\n First, here is a side-by-side photo of Will Smith and Chris Rock as they truly are:\nThey are two prominent celebrities in the entertainment industry. Over the years they have helped us to laugh, cry, and think more deeply about life, who we are, and what we represent. They aren’t bad people. Will and Chris are both beautiful, wonderful individuals. And at their core, they are no different than you and me. The only difference is that “life” has moved them into the world spotlight.\n If you could rewind the universe to its earliest known origin, you’d discover what’s called the [LINKED_TEXT: hadron epoch] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron_epoch] which began a mere 20 microseconds after the Big Bang. This strange period in universal existence represents a cosmic struggle between hadrons and antihadrons: the fundamental building blocks of everything that exists today. A hadron and antihadron are simultaneously annihilated the instant they come in contact with each other.\nYes, the universe was born out of conflict.\n This same cosmic war has been waging over the past 13.8 billion years in the form of positive and negative, matter and antimatter, strong and weak, predator and prey, life and death, science and religion, and ultimately evolving into love and hate. What happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock is a fully evolved version of “Existence” showing us who we are, how far we’ve come, and our inevitable demise should we fail to change our direction.\n Existence is offering us a movie about “us” and using two great actors to deliver its message.\nHumanity is unknowing dividing into two distinct particle types: Good and Evil. The only problem is that both sides consider their side Good and the other side Evil. Yes, we all have our fully justified reasoning for labeling the “other side” as repugnant, don’t we? However, at the fundamental level “Existence” doesn’t care one way or the other. Existence is indifferent. Existence operates by a set of fundamental properties that have existed since the beginning of time.\n When oppositional particles come into contact, mutual self-destruction ensues.\n What happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock is also taking place between Russia and Ukraine, Democrat and Republican, theist and atheist, gay and straight, black and white, and all other oppositional constructs we’ve unknowingly created over time. The only difference is that we live in a nuclear age where our existence as a species hangs in the balance.\n There is no doubt that any country that uses nuclear weapons against another will be met with a swift, opposite and equal “smack” because that’s just the way things work, … even at the subatomic level.\n However, there is hope!\n We represent the end result of a 13.8-billion-year-long evolution of “Existence” from its most basic, fundamental particles up to living, breathing, self-aware humans who can amazingly rewrite universal law. Yes, “we” have the innate ability to love each other, end our conflicts, and offer forgiveness instead of mutual self-destruction whenever we happen to collide.\nWill and Chris know what happened was wrong. You can see it in their faces. Chris never should have made that joke and Will never should have reacted as he did. If both could go back in time, no doubt this “particle collision” never would have taken place. All that remains is whether they can show the world that people can forgive each other when we err and continue to live in peace.\n These two wonderful individuals can turn a terrible event into a message of love and forgiveness that sets an all-new standard going forward. While we wait on the outcome, our wars will still be waging, our hatred will still be dividing us, our weaponry will still increase in strength, …\n … and the clock is ticking!\n', 'I believe it was a giant informercial.

Alopecia medication.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Pfizer Announces Positive Top-Line Results from Phase 2b/3 Trial of Ritlecitinib in Alopecia Areata– ALLEGRO 2b/3 trial met primary efficacy endpoint of improving scalp hair regrowth – NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive top-line results from the Phase 2b/3 ALLEGRO trial evaluating oral once-daily ritlecitinib in patients with alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease driven by an immune attack on the hair follicles that causes hair loss on the scalp and can also affect the face and body. 1,2 Ritlecitinib 50 mg and 30 mg achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, namely the proportion of patients with less than or equal to 20 percent scalp hair loss after six months of treatment versus placebo. “We are pleased by these positive results for ritlecitinib in patients with alopecia areata, a devastating and complex autoimmune disease for which there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency approved treatments,” said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to bringing this potential new treatment option to patients living with alopecia areata as soon as possible.” The Phase 2b/3 ALLEGRO trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of improving scalp hair regrowth. All participants entered the study with at least 50 percent scalp hair loss due to alopecia areata, as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who took ritlecitinib 30 mg or 50 mg once-daily, with or without a four-week initial treatment of 200 mg once-daily, had 20 percent or less scalp hair loss (an absolute SALT score ≤20) after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. This was followed by a 24-week extension period, during which all participants initially randomized to receive ritlecitinib continued on the same regimen, while participants who received placebo during the initial 24 weeks advanced to one of two regimens: 200 mg for four weeks followed by 50 mg for 20 weeks, or 50 mg for 24 weeks. The study also included a 10 mg dosing arm, which was assessed for dose-ranging and was not tested for statistically significant efficacy compared to placebo. The safety profile seen with ritlecitinib was consistent with previous studies. Overall, the percentage of patients with adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuing due to AEs was similar across all treatment groups. The most common AEs seen in the study were nasopharyngitis, headache and upper respiratory tract infection. There were no major adverse cardiac events (MACE), deaths or opportunistic infections in the trial. Eight patients who were treated with ritlecitinib developed mild to moderate herpes zoster (shingles). There was one case of pulmonary embolism in the ritlecitinib 50 mg group, which was reported to have occurred on Day 169. There were two malignancies (both breast cancers) reported in the ritlecitinib 50 mg group, which were reported to have occurred on Day 68 anhttps://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-positive-top-line-results-phase-2b3-trial] [URL: https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-positive-top-line-results-phase-2b3-trial]Nothing to see here folks\n']}, page_content='question: Why did Will Smith slap his co-star at the Oscars?'), Document(metadata={'top_answers': [""That can never happen since drummer John Bonham has been dead for 39 years.

The Wah Wah I think spoils it, too superficially used as an add-on after thought, the Wildlife version is special.\n This Lennon song is very much a “Seattle Grunge” Music Genre, before it was. As a side interest, David Bowie rang Lennon to get the Guitar part right, when he covered the song, Lennon came to the studio to play it, to help Bowie out, a VERY rare uncredited appearance for John Lennon, who felt uncomfortable playing on other musician’s Albums.\n I think of Bob Dylan’s Subterranean Homesick Blues, A7 Chord throughout, as RAP Music, before RAP Music existed. “Hats Off to Roy Harper”, a Led Zeppelin Song, is a rare example of a famous Band acknowledging a Folk Legend.

That’s a rare quality among vocalists.\n Many male vocalists can sing with edge, but what Lennon and Cobain had went beyond that. They had the rare ability to convey genuine emotion such as angst, pain or anger in their vocal delivery. Most listeners could “hear” that the emotion was genuine, not just a vocal technique. John Lennon’s “Plastic Ono Band” solo album is one of the best examples of how he could convey genuine emotion with his voice.\n Also, it’s well known that Cobain was a Beatles fan, and his songwriting displays a melodic sense that shows Beatles influences. Cobain’s songs weren’t just edgy grunge, they were melodic as well.

3201,Would you ever wear a Rolex submariner with a suit and/or blazer?,"['Forget Rolex for a minute…let me talk about this amazing watch…check the picture below…\nFor those of you who don’t know, this brand of watch is called Certina - a Swiss brand of watch started in 1888. It is not well know as Rado or Rolex (mainly because they market themselves heavily) but they come from the same umbrella of watch maker The Swatch Group. One of the unique things about this watch is that it has Double Security (DS) that makes it highly water resistant both from the crown and from the bottom (watch machine).\n Coming to this watch, apart from having DS, it is 300 m water resistant, which makes it ideal for swimming and diving (but not in Pacific Ocean) and has a sapphire crystal glass that does not crack or have scratch marks easily unless we stab it with diamond. This watch is automatic and gets powered by our hand movement and when the screen is exposed to the light, it shines when brought in dark area.\n Now, why am I mentioning this watch? It is because it is one such brand, which has a sporty look and still blends well with suits and blazer. I wear this watch when wearing casuals; going for sports; swimming or with a suit. Th colour of the dial (be it black or blue) makes it easily adaptable to any style of dressing.\n It took me 3 months to buy this watch because I tried this and several other watches in different dressing style and found only this to be an all-purpose watch.\n Moral of the story - do your research before buying a watch because whatever timepiece you purchase, it should reflect your taste and personality.\n', 'I’m a firm believer in the idea that every man should have at least one suit. Something to put on and look dapper. I also believe in the power a watch has to amplify whatever statement you want your outfit to make.\n I don’t come from money, so for a long time, even now, I struggled with the mere idea of a Rolex. To add to it, the first Rollies I ever saw people wearing were these hyper-shiny, bedazzled abominations; so it wasn’t until recently that I discovered that every Rolex isn’t a rich snob’s wet dream, in terms of aesthetics or price.\nThis is a Rolex I would gladly wear with a suit. To me, it says that I have a respect and appreciation for well-made watches, that I have the taste to wear such a watch to complement my attire, which will be simple, understated and elegant, and that I have the sense to stay away from some garish, overpriced foolishness.\n 6/11/18: Having learned a few more things about watches, and what I like in them, I’d wear a Sub with a business suit, if I were working or taking a meeting or some such. I prefer understated, so it would be black or blue. In more formal or casual settings, I wouldn’t go with a Sub; I’ve heard it said that you aren’t supposed to wear a watch for these, but fuck that, I always wear one.\n Submariner wouldn’t be my first choice. I’d feel more comfortable with something sleeker; at the same time, my taste limits my options in Rolex wearables pretty severely. The only one I can see myself wearing, in this context, would be a Milgauss.\n And if I’m out of order for that, well, whatever.\n', ""Of course you can. You can do anything you like. I have a white and orange analogue-digital 45mm diameter plastic watch that I would wear with a suit except that; a) the white and orange plastic band is broken, and; b) I never wear suits.\n Much depends on which watches you have on the surface that day. Ancient Omegas, much-loved Seiko automatic sports watches, obscure and grotesque mechanical alarm watches, 1970s automatics, old or new Rolexes can be worn. Surprise your workmates with a Patek Philipe or a $7.99 plastic Submarinoid (as worn in my bath) from Aldi, available at random times in an alarming range of colours. Casios? Movados? Wear whatever you want.\n The reality is that the great bulk of the population are non-watch people, and they won't notice at all what you wear on your wrist. Watch lovers will notice, but a 200m wr Casio digital from the early 1980s or a 1976 Omega Dynamic or a Tudor or a Seiko 6138 will suggest that you, too, like watches. The aspirational types, the show-offs, the social climbers expect (at least in my jokes) you to wear a Lange und Soehne solid gold monster or (erk) a Rolex Datejust around which someone has attached some boringly large number of diamonds. Or worse, a Richard Mille. The social climbers won't like the white and orange 45mm plastic monster.

The Rolex Submariner is a classic timepiece that\'s known for its sporty and casual design, but it can definitely be dressed up. With a suit, it can add a touch of ruggedness to your look, especially if you\'re going for a more laid-back, yet still put-together style. With a blazer and a pair of chinos or dark jeans, it\'s a perfect match. The key is to make sure the rest of your outfit balances the casualness of the watch. But ultimately, it\'s all about personal style and what makes you feel confident.\n\n**Answer 2:**\nPersonally, I wouldn\'t. The Rolex Submariner is a beautiful watch, but it\'s designed for more casual or sporty settings. When I\'m wearing a suit, I prefer to pair it with a dress watch – something slim, elegant, and understated. A Submariner might look a bit out of place with formal attire, in my opinion. But hey, rules are meant to be broken, and if you can pull it off with confidence, why not?\n\n**Answer 3:**\nAbsolutely, I think a Rolex Submariner can look fantastic with a suit or blazer. It\'s all about the overall look you\'re going for. If you\'re wearing a suit but want to dress it down a bit, the Submariner is a great choice. It\'s also a good way to show off your personal style, especially if you\'re in an environment where a suit is the norm. Just make sure the rest of your outfit complements the watch.

Not a person. Definitely not a Danish person. Nowhere in the original book does it mention that the Little Mermaid is of Danish descent, Danish origin, that any of her kind even ever set foot on danish soil before she did. She lives in the water. Not on any land. Never set foot on the land of any nation or human culture until partway through the book, so to say she is part of that culture of human s is a bad joke at best.\n The Prince I believe is meant to be Danish, though in 1989 they removed any defined nation that he might be from out of the cartoon, but did give him and his assistant Danish names.\n But of course because this isn’t about culture, it’s about melanin, the same thing racism usually is.\n In 1989 Disney:\n Gave the little mermaid a name, a Hebrew name of Ariel.\n Gave the girls father a Greek name.\n Gave the Sea Witch a Latin name not popular in northern Europe outside of England.\n Made her formerly blonde hair (at times pictured dark brown early on) red (the 1989 version was written by a person with Irish heritage).\n Made another human looking character with blue skin (a skin color not associated with Danish 19th century people).\n Changed the entire story from Danish to English\n Changed the location to the Caribbean. (remind me when this crosses the “appropriation of the Danish culture” line by the writer/directors who weren’t dark skinned).\n Removed 5 sisters.\n Took away her Grandmother.\n Made her silver scales blue/green.\n Took away her subservience to her father and the prince as would be more common and expected in 19th century Denmark and made her much more rebellious.\n Completely rewrote her transformation.\n Completely removed the heart and theme of the written story about mermaids not having Souls.\n Gave her singing and talking sea creature friends.\n All this done by an Irish Catholic born and raised in Chicago (but don’t worry, his tan was not very pronounced). But guess where the “is this appropriation” comes from? Not a word there, but the skin color being a few shades darker than some people believe it should be due to increased melanin production in the actress's body portraying the fictional sea creature which has ZERO danish descent noted in the book or the original cartoon.\n So the pro-white supremacist/nationalist groups of 4chan and 8chan and other bilges of the internet got going and of course it spread among their allies and here we are. Nothing about all those changes made but one triggers them. I wonder why the “IOTBW” groups that people like former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke have supported are actively upset here. If only we could figure this out (sarcasm). And thus we have all the false narratives, red herrings and other logical fallacies trying to say ANYTHING but where this started and grew from.\n You can’t make up just how dumb racism is when you actually look at it.\n Imagine if they made a Ghost which is described as white and with human characteristics in a light brown color instead of white like Casper. Or Pinnochio described as being of red pine instead of white pine. The melanin required to be a sea creature. This is the kind of things white supremacists get upset about in their echo chambers and blame people about ghosts, sea creatures and wooden puppet colors.\n"", ""You know what? As I have seen more and more people weigh in on this and have gotten to see a broader range of perspectives, believe it or not I actually do think that there is indeed some cultural appropriation going on here.\n Just hear me out for a second.\nThe famous statue of Den lille Havfrue in Copenhagen, where Hans Christian Andersen wrote the original story.\n Now from the outset, I should say that I have complex and often heterodox views on cultural appropriation, and I don't mean to say that the mere fact of something being an example of cultural appropriation means that it is necessarily bad or impermissible. The term implies a degree of negative judgment from which I generally try to shy away, especially when the culture that may or may not be appropriated is not my own.\n But while I am cautious when it comes to accusation and and wary of any invocation of social stigma, I think that there is room to have an educated and nuanced conversation here.\n With that being said, yes, I feel that it may very well be reasonable to say that, in the whole discussion surrounding this issue, we have indeed seen conservative grown-ass adults quite brazenly appropriate snowflake tantrum culture, despite not being between the ages of three and ten themselves.\n There was a time when it was only seen as acceptable for very young children to throw a fit because the show on the TV had somebody on it who was different from the one they wanted it to have (though as a former preschool teacher, I can attest that there were many of us who had little tolerance for it even among three-year-olds).\n However, these days those lines seem to be fading, and more and more postpubescent people seem to be flagrantly and unapologetically appropriating tantrum culture.\n Anyway, if you were totally fine with the Danish mermaid having a Hebrew man’s name but not with her having marginally darker skin in live action than she did as a cartoon, I'm afraid that you are talking about something other than cultural appropriation.\n I feel like there's a word for it, but I am drawing a blank for some racism… sorry, for some reason.\n Anyway, thanks for reading, and as they say in Denmark, “hold op med at græde, snefnug.”\n"", 'Ah, the age-old debate of whether re-imagining classic fairy tales with updated cultural representations is a form of cultural appropriation or appreciation. As it relates to Disney’s recent move to cast an African American actress as Ariel in their latest remake of The Little Mermaid, this has sparked quite the lively discussion for sure!\n At its core, I think that we can agree that the answer to this question comes down to intent. It basically boils down understanding if there was a good faith effort on Disney’s part to genuinely celebrate diversity and broaden its own representation within popular culture and storytelling versus simply using these characters as vehicles for marketing or exploiting other cultures in some way?\n The original fairytale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is very much rooted in European aesthetics and mythology so it\'s difficult if not impossible for any adaptation of this story (regardless if black Little Mermaid is used as casting) could be seen as anything but ""borrowing"" from another culture. However, that borrowing doesn\'t necessarily equate to appropriation if done fairly. For example, had Disney hired writers/performers from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds who appreciated and sought guidance from communities more aligned with those themes – rather than simply making quick decisions based off what ‘looked right’ then I feel like they would have probably better avoided accusations of appropriating another culture’s stories and practices without respect nor proper credit given where due.\n All said though, I think anytime any movie studio attempts something new (especially when introducing topics previously unheard/unseen before) there will always be critics ready express dissent which should not be taken lightly - especially when related issues such as cultural dominance & respectful acknowledgement are concerned...

Perhaps they object to Wal-Mart’s treatment of employees or suppliers. Or you buy ETSY to support independent artists.

And you’ll look forward to ask your senator. But he won’t be there anymore. He’ll be back across the void with his friends. Chatting with a executive from those banks he said feared him. Then he’ll reach out to shake his hand. Not a friendly handshake, but a deal handshake. You’ll wonder what was just said.\n Then the president comes on the intercom. Maybe you voted for him or maybe not, but it hardly matter now. Because he’s already launched into a rhapsody about the accomplishments of some big shot. He says something like “secretary of the treasury” then gestures. How the the bank guy get on the platform anyway? Why is he stepping up to the microphone?

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!”\n “I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college…”\n No, with due respect, you do not.\n Not if you have bought into the oft-repeated canard that the Electoral College exists only due to the limitations of late-Eighteenth-Century communication.\n This is a fantasy invented originally by the Populists of the late-Nineteenth and early-Twentieth Centuries—that the Founders would have loved to have a populist, nationwide, direct democracy, if only it hadn’t been so hard to tally a nationwide vote.\n In fact, the fact that we (the common people) vote at all for the President is a historical accident—it’s not mandated anywhere in the Constitution, and that’s entirely on purpose.\n The Electoral College was created precisely because the Founders and Framers did not want direct democracy. They hated the idea of direct democracy, seeing it as the equal and opposite evil of authoritarianism and monarchy.\nFirst, let us simply observe that the Framers of the Constitution were very smart men, and held extensive debates on points of drafting that probably would never have even occurred to 90% of modern Americans. If they had wanted direct election of the President, but communication had been the issue, they easily could have drafted Article II differently in any number of ways.\n Most obviously, they could have stipulated that what we practically do today would be the actual law—i.e., the people cast ballots for a President, and the winner of each State’s “popular vote” simply automatically tallies that State’s Electoral College votes.\n But they didn’t.\n Instead, they mandated actual Electors who would physically and individually cast their votes, and they granted the selection of those Electors to the States, not to the people.\nEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.\n —U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 1, Clause 2\nThis means (as I’m fond of reminding people) that there would be nothing remotely unconstitutional if the State of Somesuch decided that its Electors would be:\nVoted on by the legislature rather than the peopleAppointed at the sole discretion of the governorDrawn by lotSelected randomly from a phonebookDetermined by the kibble preference of Harry the Election Gerbil\nNow, some historians have argued (with extremely strong plausibility, mind you) that the Framers expected that the Electoral College would work much as it does in Maine and Nebraska—where each Congressional district elects one Elector, and two are selected in the same manner as Senators (i.e., in modern times by statewide popular vote, but in the Founding Era by legislative appointment).\n But that is not what they wrote. They gave the States discretion to do that or to do some other thing (and in fact, in the first several elections, there were States which had no popular vote for President, or which had already adopted a “winner-take-all” system)—and even when James Madison himself drafted a proposed Amendment compelling that method, it was not adopted.\n Moreover, even those who advocated most strongly for district-based election of Electors (e.g., Madison and Hamilton) also strongly defended the propriety of having Electors, rather than a mere popular vote. Their theory (again, not necessarily matching modern reality) was that the people would vote for men whose judgment they could trust, and then those trusted men would evaluate the presidential candidates and select the best one. It was anticipated that the Electors would typically be known to favor one particular candidate, and that most of the time, they’d end up voting for that candidate—but the “faithless electors” we heard a lot about in 2016 were part of the system, not feckless rebels scoffing at American democracy. It was expected that the Electors would act as a final “sanity check” on the will of the voters.\nFurthermore, it is quite clear, reading the debates and the Federalist Papers, that the Framers did not see Americans as undifferentiated citizens of a single sovereign—such that the vote of all Americans should be tallied and relied upon en masse.\n They saw America as a confederate (small-c) union of thirteen sovereign States.\n So it was entirely logical to them that the votes of Virginians should have no impact whatsoever on the choice of Electors for Massachusetts or Georgia.\n If the voters of Massachusetts had, say, a 90% preference for their native son, John Adams, but the voters of Georgia had, say, a 54% preference for Thomas Jefferson, the Framers would still have given Massachusetts and Georgia voters the same number of Electors as if the percentages had been reversed. And that is exactly what a national popular vote would not do—it would say that if California overwhelmingly favored Hillary, those “extra” Californian votes should “cancel out” Trump’s comparatively narrower margins in Wisconsin.\nSo, in brief:\nThe Electoral College ensures that voters are represented by State, not in an undifferentiated national mass. This is intended, not an accidental artifact of communication difficulties in the Eighteenth Century.The Electoral College is supposed to allow for trusted men (and women) to stand as a final bulwark of rationality and civic sense against the potentially unwise judgment of the people as a whole. This also is intended, not an accidental artifact.\nIn the brief period in which Madison in particular did initially support a popular vote, his reasons for abandoning it had nothing to do with communication difficulties, and were instead related to the same population demographics and population density issues that spawned both the Connecticut Compromise and the Three-Fifths Compromise. And he later became a strong supporter of the Electoral College.\n', ""By the second half of your last sentence, I believe the first half to be incorrect: you do NOT understand the historical reasons for the electoral college. It is not there as a way to make up for the limitations of antiquated modes of communication. Thay wouldn't even make any sense. How would it? It is adding ANOTHER layer of complexity to the process, requiring MORE time and effort than a pure popular vote would, even back when it was first created. The notion that the electoral college was originally intended to avoid communication delays is a fiction that started being preached when Democrats started losing elections that they thought that they had won. It is, and has always been there to ensure that we have, as the founders intended, a republic, and not a pure democracy. The founders correctly recognized that a pure democracy is “two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner”. It not only allows, but ensures the tyranny of the majority. The electoral college system helps prevent that by ensuring that the result of an election is not ever determined by a numerical majority of voters in a geographical minority of locations. Removing the electoral college results in something like the Hunger Games, where the country is ruled by a populous and affluent metropolitan area, and the less populous, more rural areas have absolutely no say in the policies that govern them. This is especially problematic because large metropolitan population centers tend to be much more uniform in their political views than utlying areas, as well as being uniformly uninformed about the issues and realities of life outside the big cities. Historically, Democrats play to the inclinations of the large cities, and even demonize the rural areas in order to ensure a win in those important voting blocs. The gamble that they make is that by clinching the metropolitan vote, they risk losing the rest of the country. The Republicans usually do the opposite. They campaign in a much more broadly appealing way. This means that they often lose several minority votes, as well as the votes of the cities who loyally vote for Democrats who pander to those minorities. On he balance, they gain enough of the test of the country that they can offset the choke hold the Democrats have on the major cities. The fact that sometimes Democrats win the popular vote, but lose the election is an intentional feature, not a bug. Systems of pure democracy have ALWAYS very quickly become tyrannical, and ended up as totalitarian dictatorships. This was known to the founders at the time they designed our system of government, and was accounted for in their designs. This is the same reason we have a Senate instead of just a mob of Representatives. In fact, for a while, the founders debated having the Senate elect the president directly, since each state gets exactly 2 senators. This was thrown out since it unfairly benefited the least populous states. The electoral college was found to be the best compromise between senatorial and popular elections. Because of the electoral college system, candidates need to run a campaign that appeals to ALL states, and not just a select few with a high population. The Democrats keep forgetting this, and then when they lose, they blame the system. Hillary Clinton didn't even visit several states, and when they didn't vote for her, she complained that it wasn't fair. The rules haven't changed. She knew them going into the race. Her husband had the exact same system to deal with when he was elected. Democrats only complain about them when they lose.\n"", 'Yes, I believe so. Before last year, I think relatively few Americans were even really aware of the electoral college. Even so, enough people are convinced that states representing 165 electors (of the 270 required for a majority) have already signed onto a compact obligating them to essentially move to a popular vote once 270 electors sign on: [LINKED_TEXT: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact]\n Even more so than most countries, rural parts of the US are at war with the urban. Have been since the civil war, but it’s intensified since Lee Atwater decided to corner the political market on southerners and make a party which explicitly caters to rural areas and racial grudges, something he freely admitted he was doing. And I’m only slightly exaggerating when I say war, since it has actually come to that in the past, and during the civil rights movement Northern civilians were attacked by police and State militias representing a particular point of view.\n And this is a mechanism placed into our constitution by an unfortunate compromise made with the slave trade. Don’t believe it? Look at the two items in the constitution that are not subject to amendment: slavery and the overrepresentation of Small (primarily slave) states in Congress. Add in the 3/5 compromise, essentially assigning yet more overrepresentation to southerners, and you might thInk the pro-electoral-college arguments are just a smokescreen that’s been going for 240 years.\n Now, inevitably, someone is going to bring up that the founders never intended a popular vote. Which is true, but irrelevant. They are long gone, and it’s a very different nation now. I’m pretty confident that they would be far more outraged by our political parties (which they were adamantly opposed to) and the quality of people in office, than by proposals to get rid of the “small state” advantages, which many of them saw as an odious compromise— or a good one, if they were from a small state. If the founding fathers were here today, they might propose something very much like superdelegates (but across party lines, since there would be no parties), chosen from state legislators, governors and prominent people — who would get together in a room and pick a President with no public involvement. Like I said, it’s a different country today.\n And sure, people are extra outraged when an election goes so strongly against the popular vote — for the second time, since Al Gore won the popular vote by half a million votes while losing the EC, and now, Hillary won by 3M and lost the EC. And sure, the folks who got the short end of the stick are the most exercised about it. Nothing wrong with that.\n Not trying to relitigate the election, but I do wish we could fix this for the future. Between this and the gerrymandered house— where Democrats are also consistently winning the popular vote while winding up with a minority of seats— and one person, one vote looks like a bad joke— it’s more like 1 Wyoming person, 4 votes. And as the nation further urbanizes and further concentrates into the big states, New Yorkers, Californians, and Texans will screwed over more and more each year until it gets fixed.\n Go NPVIC!\n']}, page_content='question: Do many Americans want to decide the Presidency directly, rather than by using the electoral college?

The power goes out around 2 am.\nSo we woke up. My husband gets up. He wakes up when the lights go out. But after a while the light comes on. They also fall asleep. After some time, the sound of banging on the outside door is heard. He wakes me up as to who is at night at this time. I thought that he must be speaking like this in his sleep, but after some time I also heard some voice. When I woke my husband, he looked outside and found that no one was there.\n But another scary thing came to the fore that the light of the bedroom below was burning.\n Every day we sleep with the bedroom lights off. So how is it burning? Different types of thoughts were coming in our mind like this. There is no one else in the house except the two of us. Because we were not at home for 7 days, no one has come inside the house?\n I was very scared what to do. My house is a little far from the city, not many houses are built nearby.\n We both dared to leave the room. He has looked at the whole house with a big stick. We don't see anything. So many questions were coming in our mind that after all, who knocked on the door and turned on the light cone of the bedroom.\n And some time before that the power would have gone further.\n We were both trembling with fear.\n After some time the watchman of our colony makes two rounds in the night. We waited for him to come, we sat and watched by the window.

I had called my friend earlier and talked to him. He explained to us that if there is no one in the house then there is nothing to be afraid of.\n Sometimes we come back home after many days, on the first day we feel some fear in our own house. The same thing happened to us that night. We did not understand who knocked on the door. One of us lit the light in the bedroom and went to sleep. And the same night the electricity also goes out.

Maybe you'll agree with it unaware something may happen, maybe you'll agree with the risk, maybe I'll lie to you or even do it against your will. When it starts reproducing and a tumor will start growing, I'll offer you money if you keep it growing( because I want to have my creation or because I think that tumors are cute) for some 40 weeks. You'll of course be sick, aching and all your nutrients and energy will go to the growth that may or may not kill you before it's large enough. Of course you'll be prohibited to take any meds or do anything about your health that could possibly interfere with the tumor. You'll be on a strict diet even though you may be unable to eat anything for periods of time. You'll have to tough it out. Of course I'll expect you to go about your life like nothing's going on in your body. I will then force you to choose( if you're lucky) if you go through a surgery to extract it ( the only anesthetic given will be a large needle to your spine) or to push it out of your body. Let's not forget that this will involve 12+h at best of contractions( aka the most intensive pain you'll ever know). You'll need some 8 weeks ( at best again) to recover from it and you'll be bleeding the entire time. You'll be expected to again handle everything else while at it and in addition, since the tumor won't be alive will have to take a doll baby for this part, I'll make sure that every 3 hours you feed the doll ( you're still lucky that all your nutrients won't go into producing breast milk and having your nipples chewed raw in order to do that), change the diaper and make it go to sleep. If you're really lucky that doll will keep crying for hours on an end because of being colicky or sick or just because they feel not completely at ease. You'll have to carry that doll around and it'll be with you every moment of your life until reaching the school age, where you may enjoy the little free time at work.\n Scenario no 2: I'll want you to impregnate me. That means you'll be on a strict healthy diet, no meds, no alcohol, no cigs, no s*x( and no masturbation either) unless you're depositing to the cup. Of course I'll pay you for that but I'll have total control over your life until I'm pregnant. I'll give you the baby to take care of once it's here to enjoy that part.\n Scenario no 3: I'll pay you to give me your kidney. It's not like I need a kidney, I just think that kidneys are cute and it's a reasonable thing to ask of you. Again this will involve strict diet, no fun in life, no meds and you'll be recovering from the surgery while being forced to go about your life as nothing's really happened.\n None of those scenarios really involve the full physical and mental toll of a pregnancy, childbirth and raising a baby. Keep that in mind and let me know which one you're up to.\n No, the answer is still no. The father has no say in that because all the support and money still doesn't equal to what a pregnancy, childbirth and having a baby means for the mother.\n Btw to give you the info you're missing obviously, during my pregnancy I had gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism discovered(to explain what that means, strict diet and regular intervals between meals-2/3 hours to be exact, pricking your finger 10 times a day at an exact timing to measure your glucose level, meds, insulin), I was unable to stomach anything else but a ramen noodles and broth and very limited choice of vegetable the entire first trimester. The smell of the neighbors freshly done laundry made me sick as a dog. When taking the public transport i had to make breaks to vomit, I couldn't travel by car. I started bleeding very early on and was put on bed rest. I nearly died from COVID. My feet and legs swole and couldn't fit to any shoes. When my joints got lose I went through a series of twisted ankles, dislocated knees and shoulders. I couldn't sleep at night because of heavy sweats and not being able to find a position in which my huge belly wouldn't compress my lungs. I couldn't breathe any way. I enjoyed teeth extraction because my molars rot and got inflamed because all my calcium went to create my daughter's bones. Recurring UTIs. During the third trimester I had to be put on meds to lower my blood pressure, a thing that didn't work and eventually I had to be hospitalized and induced to give birth earlier. My daughter still was 3,9 kg at birth. The labor ended in 4th degree tear and a broken coccyx which made me unable to sit or lay on my back for months. For the first 3 weeks I was on laxatives and a strict no solids diet because I couldn't afford to have a normal bowel movement and the stitches on my rectum and anus to break. I bled through all my clothes regularly during the entire postpartum ( 8 weeks)—and no, you can't use a tampon because of a high risk of introducing infection to the uterus. I stopped being incontinent about a year after the birth and I'm the lucky one. I still have a 10 cm diastasis where my abs separated and a few hernias that need to be solved surgically. I haven't slept more than 2 hours for the first 6 months of my baby because my daughter had non stop colics until we discovered a food allergy was the cause. The childbirth gave me PTSD and a nasty case of neonatal depression. And I'm still the lucky one because I didn't die. Yeah, pregnancy and childbirth kills.\n Tell me that you think that money and being there can somehow make up for all that.\n"", 'As my father used to say, “The devil is in the details”.\n Let’s contemplate three simple scenarios to illustrate:\nThe man raped the woman (yes, marital rape is a thing). Nobody in their right mind is going to give a rapist a child. You’re just rewarding rape. The woman should be allowed to abort if she chooses. The rapist should get zero say in anything.The woman’s doctor has informed her that the pregnancy is very high risk and there’s a high chance she might die. Why should this man be allowed to pass a death sentence over his partner? Would you be happy if your wife or partner could decide to kill you at any time? No. Again, the woman should be allowed to protect her life if she chooses.The woman knows darned well that they can’t afford this child, and that it would be a financial disaster for the family. She wants this child, but runs the numbers again and again, and no matter how many costs she cuts she knows they’ll be out on the street in 6 months or less, and starving. They’ll probably die. The baby will almost certainly die. She decides that having an abortion is the only possible decision. It hurts. She wants this child. Her heart breaks. She knows they live in a country where even a minor medical emergency can put people in poverty for the rest of their lives, and childbirth isn’t a minor procedure and has major long-term costs. … why would she share this heartbreak with her husband or partner? But her partner finds out and insists he can do it. But she’s been over the finances a dozen times, and frankly her partner is just wrong. He’s just making a heartbreaking decision even harder.\nThese are the details that so-called “pro-lifers” (more accurately anti-choice facists) like to ignore. And they’re what is important.\n Anti-choice rhetoric relies on gross over-simplifications of what is a difficult, often heart-breaking, and intensely personal, decision. These simplifications cross the line from being just simplifications to outright lies.\n Should a woman discuss their decision with their husband or partner? It should be her choice. Because you don’t know what she’s dealing with. You don’t know a darned thing about her situation. But anti-choicers want to pass dumb simplistic laws that force women to do things that make an already difficult situation a thousand times worse.\n That’s just torturing women. It’s blatant misogynisitic bullshit. There is no debate here, not when you actually learn about people’s real situations. But the anti-choice brigade don’t want to get into the details, because they know darned well that no sane or reasonable person would support their policies then.\n', 'The problem is that word: “a say”.\n What does that mean, exactly? Does he get to explain and advocate for his position? Surely. I mean, unless the relationship has broken down enough that the woman refuses to talk to him anymore.\n But if “a say” is more than just giving his opinion, what would that mean, exactly? What happens if a woman wants an abortion, and the man doesn’t want her to have an abortion? She goes to the clinic for the procedure, what happens next? Does the clinic need to see consent from the man before the abortion can happen?\n If the father must consent before the abortion, that doesn’t mean that the man “gets a say”. It means that only his say matters. If she can’t have an abortion without his consent, then that means that her consent is meaningless and must be ignored.\n Either an abortion happens, or it doesn’t happen.\n If a man has the right to prevent the abortion he doesn’t want, then that means a woman has no right to an abortion. We’ve decided that his say is all that matters, and her say means nothing. She wants to end the pregnancy. He doesn’t. Therefore, his decision must be followed. You can only give the man “a say” by removing the woman’s “say”. There is no other possible option, because there’s no such thing as half an abortion.\n And what about instances where a woman doesn’t know who the father is? Or claims to not know the father? There is no DNA database, where they can do a DNA test of the embryo and figure out which of the 4 billion men on the planet is the father, so they can get his consent. Paternity tests work by seeing of the child’s DNA matches a potential father’s DNA, not by comparing the child’s DNA to a global or national database.\n So, are we going to ban abortions in a case where a woman claims to not know the father? If we don’t ban those abortions, then even if there’s a law that says the father must consent to the abortion, all a woman has to do to get around the law is to just claim to not know the identity of the father. Are we going to mandate an investigation of paternity before allowing abortions?\n Let’s be clear. What giving men “a say” really means is banning abortion. That’s the real goal. And then it will be perfectly fair, because then a woman will never be able to get a legal abortion when the man doesn’t approve. The real goal is criminalizing all abortion and enslaving women.\n']}, page_content=""question: For pro-choice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?""), Document(metadata={'top_answers': [""Literally all of them. I'm not even being facetious. Guns don't work like in video games, where it takes a certain number of shots to burn through someone's hit points, and where armor applies a percentage to the damage. Bullets enter your body at high speed, and they smash stuff up as they move through you. The faster they are going, the more they smash, since they create a shockwave inside the body. Anything the bullet hits directly is punctured or obliterated, depending on how big and fast the bullet is. Certain shapes of bullet can increase the shock wave, or reduce it to allow the bullet to slow down less, for deeper penetration, or even fragment to create multiple bullets (effectively) moving through the body with the effects mentioned above. The overall effect of the bullet, therefore, depends on it's placement. A .50 BMG bullet can enter your body, pass through, and exit without damaging any vital organs if it hits in the right spot, whereas a .22 short can enter the skull, and kill you by bouncing around inside the brain case, scrambling up the brain matter until it comes to rest inside. A 5.56mm bullet can pierce the medulla oblongata with a direct shot between the eyes, causing instantaneous death, and a .177 pellet from an air gun can pierce an artery, causing an obstruction, massive stroke, and effectively cause instantaneous death.\n For that matter, a 9mm bullet can bounce off of the skull after a headshot, and cause nothing more than bleeding, and maybe a concussion. In certain situations, a person can be shot 20 times in the chest, completely destroying his heart and lungs, but still be able to physically assault the shooter.\n Guns in real life are completely different from guns in video games. Gun in movies are just ridiculous.\n"", 'The only way to ensure it’s immediate is to hit in the brainstem. The junction between the pons and medulla would be a good choice. Your chance of hitting that spot is essentially nil, but for argument’s sake, let’s pretend you have better than x-ray vision and are a good enough shot to knock the eyelashes off a gnat at a hundred yards. Next you need an adequate caliber (your question) and a bullet construction that will tend not to deviate when it hits bone, or break up, and of course it has to be powerful enough to penetrate despite those bones being in the way. That leave out the little rimfires and 25 ACP. Pretty well any centerfire rifle cartridge will do, and handgun cartridges from the 32’s up will probably be OK if you choose the bullet in it very carefully and are perfect with your shot placement.\n Or you can do like most of us do, shoot center mass with something reasonably adequate for defense, and worry more about stopping the threat rather than killing instantly.\n', 'As long as we are talking about firearms and not artillery - one does not exist.\n Lethality is mostly a matter of shot placement to vital organs and arteries, and generally, the rate at which the shot person loses blood. Multiple hits = more holes = faster bleed out = quicker death.\n No wise self-defense shooter would count on one shot from ANY firearm to STOP an attacker. And BTW, we don’t intentionally “shoot to kill.” We shoot to STOP the attack. If I can do that with 1 well placed shot and he/she survives, good - now they get to stand trial.

The other extant traditional religious communities of the Middle East have religions which are either completely Abrahamic (like Islam, Christianity, Judaism or Samaritanism), semi-Abrahamic (like Yazidism) or at least related to Abrahamism (like Mandaeism).\n Secondly, Zoroastrianism is a religion rooted among the indiginous traditions of some Indo-European speakers, specifically of the Iranic subbranch. It is the only Indo-European religious tradition historically surviving in the Middle East, and nowadays moreover also pretty much the only wholly continuously surviving Indo-European religion from other than the Indian spectrum worldwide.\n Thirdly, the Iranic people actually lived roughly from the area of the contemporary Tajikistan in the Central Asia through the area of the contemporary Afghanistan to the area of the contemporary Iran in the Middle East. Zoroastrianism is widely considered to reflect in its roots the ancient Iranic cultural continuum stretching between the east of Iran and the Central Asia. It is thus not purely nor typically Middle Eastern religion, it is a religion anciently reflecting the easternmost periphery of the Middle East and/or beyond.*\n* “Avestan society represents one of the most difficult problems. Its has long been established that its material culture was archaic. The Avesta makes no mention of iron, although bronze was in use; and a sophisticated urban life, enduring states or crafts practised separately from farming are unknown. The Gāθās, the earliest part of the Avesta, which reflect the material culture and social relations of eastern Iran and Middle Asia in the pre-Achaemenid period, depict a society of sedentary herdsmen and farmers, still preserving a system of clan and tribal relationships. As the clan communes disintegrated, so early class units began to spring up, and the emergence of classes is reflected in the Gāθās, which contain a protest against the rule of the tribal elite.”(M.

Why, then, do you request my answer?\n Your contention is that Greek letters are derived from hieroglyphs. I await with baited breath your peer-reviewed paper on that extraordinary claim. Until I've seen your evidence on that, I'll treat it as ‘unproven assertion'.\n I will also note how unusual it is for a linguist of any credibility to make the basic error of referring to the language as ‘Hieroglyphics'. The language was Hieroglyphic (without the s) and the individual characters were called Hieroglyphs. People who haven't got a clue often think the language is called Hieroglyphics, although I'm sure that in the case of a cutting-edge linguist such as yourself, the error is merely a typo.\n The Coptic language contains 32 characters, of which the majority were Greek, and 7 were of Egyptian Demotic.\n Coptic, unlike every previous Egyptian language, was written left-to-right. Hieratic and Demotic were always written right-to-life, while Hieroglyphic was much more free-form and could even be written top-to-bottom as well as both directions horizontally.\n Coptic contained a great many Greek loan words.\n It is tempting to think of Coptic as the ‘Christian' language because of its association with the Coptic church. However, Coptic pre-dates Christianity.\n"", 'I think you have your facts slightly backwards.\n 1) Egypt was conquered by Alexander the great in 332 BC\n 2) This was the start of the Ptolemaic period when Egypt was ruled by descendants of Alexander generals and Greek became the administrative language of the country which was called Πτολεμαϊκὴ βασιλεία “The ptolemaic kingdom” => Guess why the “Rosetta stone” was written in Greek and Egyptian…\n 3) The coptic alphabet was developed around 200BC to write the egyptian language alphabetically using the greek alphabet and a few extra signs from demotic egyptians to represent sounds that did not exist in greek.\n For example: Ϣ to represent the /ʃ/ (sh) sound that does not exist in greek but is common in egyptian.\n 4) Egyptian texts became almost exclusively written in the coptic alphabet after that (hieroglyphic and demotic writing progressively disappeared).\n 5) This remain the core writing system in Egypt until the muslim conquest which progressively imposed arabic.\n So greek letters do not come from coptic but it is really the other way around.\n If that is any consolation, the greek alphabet does descend from the phoenician script which itself is thought to derive from Proto-sinaic script (Sinai Region) a close neighbour of egyptian.\n']}, page_content='question: Why do so many people believe that Coptic script is written in Greek letters, when Greek letters originate from Hieroglyphics in its Coptic form?'), Document(metadata={'top_answers': [""reincarnation is a myth.

This philosophy encourages its followers to actively participate in good, which has a universal appeal.\n\nLastly, Zoroastrianism has a deep respect for nature and its elements, particularly fire, which is considered a symbol of divine light. This reverence for nature resonates with many people today who are concerned about the environment.\n\nMoreover, its unique rituals, rich history, and the fact that it has survived for thousands of years despite significant adversity, all add to its appeal.

Here are the steps:\nWe start by making a change of variable to eliminate the quadratic term. Let x = y - 2/3b. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n8(y - 2/3b)³ - 6(y - 2/3b) - 1 = 0\n Expanding and simplifying, we get:\n 8y³ - 36by² + 48b²y - 27b³ - 6y + 4b = 0\nWe now look for a value of p such that the equation can be written in the form:\ny³ + py = q\n where q and p are constants.\n We can see that p = -6/8 = -3/4. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n y³ - 3/4y = -1/8\nWe now need to find the values of u and v such that:\nu³ = -q/2 + sqrt(q²/4 + p³/27) v³ = -q/2 - sqrt(q²/4 + p³/27)\n where sqrt denotes the square root function.\n Substituting the values of p and q, we get:\n u³ = 27/8 + sqrt(729/64 + 27/64) v³ = 27/8 - sqrt(729/64 + 27/64)\n Simplifying, we get:\n u³ = 9 + 3sqrt(3) v³ = 9 - 3sqrt(3)\nWe can now solve for y by using the formulas:\ny = u^(1/3) + v^(1/3)\n where u and v are the values obtained in step 3.\n Substituting the values of u and v, we get:\n y = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3)\nFinally, we can solve for x by using the formula:\nx = y - 2/3b\n where b is the coefficient of the quadratic term in the original equation.\n Substituting the value of y and the value of b = -6/8 = -3/4, we get:\n x = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) - 1/2\n Therefore, the solution to the equation 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 by Cardano's method is:\n x = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) - 1/2\n"", ""Yes, I can help you solve this equation using Cardano's method.\n Cardano's method is a formula for finding the roots of a cubic equation.

So, the sum is equal to (1 + 10)/2 * 10 = 55.\n Another way to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 quickly is to use the ""casting out nines"" method. This method is based on the fact that the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 9. In this case, the sum of the digits of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 45, which is divisible by 9. So, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is also divisible by 9.

3208,has a positive integer solution?,"[""The answer by [LINKED_TEXT: Alon Amit] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Alon-Amit] gives an easy solution to the question, but it raises a more interesting question of whether there are always solutions to the equation when [math]\\gcd(a,b)=1[/math]. The answer is yes. For every [math]n[/math], there are infinitely many solutions to [math]a^2+b^2=c^n[/math] where [math]a,b,c[/math] are pairwise coprime. By proving this, we will also obtain a procedure to generate all possible solutions.\n Consider any [math]u,v \\in \\Z^+[/math] such that [math]\\gcd(u,v)=1[/math] and [math]u,v[/math] have opposite parity. Now consider the Gaussian integer [math]u+iv[/math] and its conjugate [math]u-iv[/math]. Since [math]\\gcd(u+iv,u-iv)=\\gcd(u+iv,2u)[/math] and [math]\\gcd(N(u+iv),N(2u))[/math] [math]=\\gcd(u^2+v^2,4u^2) =1[/math], we have that [math]u+iv[/math] and [math]u-iv[/math] are coprime.\n Let [math](u+iv)^n=a+ib[/math] and [math]u^2+v^2=c[/math]. We see that [math](u-iv)^n=a-ib[/math] and\n [math]\\displaystyle \\begin{align} a^2+b^2 &= (a+ib)(a-ib) \\\\ & = (u+iv)^n (u-iv)^n \\\\ &= ((u+iv)(u-iv))^n \\\\&= (u^2+v^2)^n \\\\ \\implies a^2+b^2 &=c^n \\end{align} \\tag*{}[/math]\n If [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] shared a prime factor, this would result in [math]a+bi[/math] and [math]a-bi[/math] also sharing a prime factor, however we have unique prime factorization in the Gaussian integers which means that [math](u+iv)^n=a+ib[/math] and [math](u-iv)^n=a-ib[/math] are also coprime. Therefore, [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] are coprime as desired, which would also immediately imply that [math]a,b,c[/math] are pairwise coprime. (If you take norms, you can further see that [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have opposite parity).\n The converse is also true for [math]n \\gt 1[/math]. Every primitive solution (where [math]\\gcd(a,b)=1[/math]) is generated by this procedure. To see this, first notice that [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] cannot both be odd (consider the equation modulo [math]4[/math]). Again by the above argument [math]a+ib[/math] and [math]a-ib[/math] are coprime, and since their product is an [math]n[/math]th power, so are [math]a+ib[/math] and [math]a-ib[/math] (upto multiplication by units, but we can just multiply by [math]i[/math] or [math]-1[/math] and still retain this parametrization). Now [math]a \\pm bi =(u \\pm vi)^n[/math], where [math]u,v[/math] are coprime and have opposite parity. (In the case of [math]n=1[/math], there is the extra case of [math]r^2+s^2=t[/math] where [math]r[/math] and [math]s[/math] are odd).\n In fact, every solution to [math]a^2+b^2=c^n[/math] can be generated from the above procedure using the mappings [math](u,v) \\mapsto (a,b,c)[/math] and [math](r,s) \\mapsto (r,s,t)[/math].\n Every nonzero solution [math](a,b,c)[/math] (upto sign) can be parametrized as (for [math]k \\in \\Z^+[/math]):\n[math]n[/math] is even: [math](k^{\\frac n2}a, k^{\\frac n2}b, kc)[/math] and the trivial solutions [math](k^{\\frac n2}, 0, k)[/math] and [math](0, k^{\\frac n2}, k)[/math].[math]n[/math] is odd: [math](k^na,k^nb,k^2c)[/math] and [math](k^nt^{\\frac {n-1}{2}}r,k^nt^{\\frac {n-1}{2}}s,k^2t)[/math]\nTo get all solutions, include the solutions you get when you replace [math]a\\mapsto-a[/math], [math]b \\mapsto -b[/math] and when [math]n[/math] is even, [math]c \\mapsto -c[/math], and of course the trivial solution [math](0,0,0)[/math]. (If you're wondering why go through all this when we can also get all solutions if we just eliminate the conditions on [math]u,v[/math] above, the advantage is that this parametrization produces a bijective correspondence. In other words, we are guaranteed to not get the same solution twice in this procedure).\n Some examples of primitive solutions:\n[math]n=2:(a,b)=(u^2-v^2, 2uv)[/math] [math]\\displaystyle u+iv=4+3i \\implies 7^2+24^2=25^2[/math][math]n=3:(a,b)=(u^3-3uv^2,3u^2v-v^3)[/math] [math]\\displaystyle u+iv=4+i \\implies 47^2+52^2=17^3[/math][math]\\displaystyle n=4:(a,b)=(u^4-6u^2v^2+v^4,4u^3v-4uv^3)[/math] [math]\\displaystyle u+iv=3+2i \\implies 119^2+120^2=13^4[/math][math]\\displaystyle n=5:(a,b)=(u^5-10u^3v^2+5uv^4,5u^4v-10uv^3+v^5)[/math] [math]\\displaystyle u+iv=1+2i \\implies 41^2+38^2=5^5[/math]\n"", 'In order to solve the Diophantine equation:\n [math]a^2+b^2 = c^n … (1)[/math]\n we just want to express the positive integer [math]c^n[/math] as sum of two squares.

We can do this by using the following formulas:\n p = (3ac - b²) / 3a² q = (2b³ - 9abc + 27a²d) / 27a³\n where a, b, c, and d are the coefficients of the cubic equation.\n Substituting the values, we get:\n a = 1, b = 0, c = -3/4, and d = -1/8\n p = (3 x 1 x (-3/4) - 0²) / (3 x 1²) = -1/2\n q = (2 x 0³ - 9 x 1 x (-3/4) x (-1/8) + 27 x 1² x (-1/8)) / 27 = -1/64\n Now we need to use Cardano's formula to find the roots of the equation:\n x = (u + v) - b / 3a\n where\n u = (q + √(q² + 4p³/27))^(1/3) v = (q - √(q² + 4p³/27))^(1/3)\n Substituting the values, we get:\n u = (-1/64 + √((-1/64)² + 4(-1/2)³/27))^(1/3) v = (-1/64 - √((-1/64)² + 4(-1/2)³/27))^(1/3)\n Simplifying the expressions, we get:\n u = (-1/64 + √(13/1728))^(1/3) v = (-1/64 - √(13/1728))^(1/3)\n u ≈ 0.5874 v ≈ -1.1748\n Substituting these values into the formula for x, we get:\n x1 = u + v ≈ -0.4173 x2 = -(u + v)/2 + i√3/2(u - v) ≈ 0.2991 + 0.5198i x3 = -(u + v)/2 - i√3/2(u - v) ≈ 0.2991 - 0.5198i\n Therefore, the solutions of the equation 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 are approximately:\n x1 ≈ -0.4173 x2 ≈ 0.2991 + 0.5198i x3 ≈ 0.2991 - 0.5198i\n Note that the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, so x2 and x3 are complex conjugates of each other\n"", 'क्यूबिक्स के लिए कार्डानो की विधि।\n ￼\n क्या आप इस समीकरण 8x³-6x-1=0 को कार्डन की विधि से हल कर सकते हैं?\n हां, हम 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 समीकरण को हल करने के लिए कार्डानो की विधि का उपयोग कर सकते हैं।\n चरण 1: समीकरण को अवनत घन में बदलें हम x = y - b/3 को प्रतिस्थापित करके ऐसा कर सकते हैं, जहाँ b द्विघात पद का गुणांक है, और y एक नया चर है। इस स्थिति में, b = 0, इसलिए हमें यह प्रतिस्थापन करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।\n चरण 2: समीकरण को y^3 + py = q के रूप में लिखें x के लिए नई अभिव्यक्ति के गुणांक का उपयोग करके, हम मूल समीकरण को y^3 - 2y = 1/8 के रूप में फिर से लिख सकते हैं। इससे हमें p = 0 और q = 1/8 प्राप्त होता है।\n चरण 3: t का मान ज्ञात करें मान लीजिए t एक नया चर है जैसे कि y = u - t/u। इसे समीकरण y^3 + py = q में प्रतिस्थापित करने और सरल करने पर, हमें u^6 - 2tu^3 - q = 0 मिलता है। हम t को चुनना चाहते हैं ताकि इस समीकरण का एक परिमेय मूल हो। ऐसा करने का एक तरीका t = 1 चुनना है। फिर समीकरण u^6 - 2u^3 - 1/8 = 0 तक सरल हो जाता है।\n चरण 4: u के लिए हल करें मान लीजिए z = u^3। फिर चरण 3 से समीकरण z^2 - 2z - 1/8 = 0 हो जाता है। द्विघात सूत्र का उपयोग करके, हमें z = 1/4 ± √(17)/4 मिलता है। इन मानों का घनमूल लेने पर हमें u = (1 ± √(17))/2∛2 मिलता है।\n चरण 5: y के लिए हल करें अब जबकि हमें u मिल गया है, हम y = (1 ± √(17))/2∛2 - 1/((((1 ± √(17))/2∛2 - 1/((( 1 ± √(17))/2∛2) = (1 ± √(17))/2∛2 - (1 ∓ √(17))/2∛2। सरल करने पर, हमें y = ∛2(√(17) ± 3) प्राप्त होता है।\n चरण 6: x के लिए हल करें अंत में, हम x के लिए समाधान प्राप्त करने के लिए मूल प्रतिस्थापन x = y - b/3 = y = ∛2(√(17) ± 3) का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:\n x = ∛2(√(17) + 3) x = -∛2(√(17) - 3) x = ∛2(-√(17) + 3)\n इसलिए, समीकरण 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 के समाधान लगभग 0.2018, -1.1833, और 0.9815 हैं।\n']}, page_content=""question: Can you solve this equation 8x³-6x-1=0 by Cardan's method?""), Document(metadata={'top_answers': ['64, as it’s the only one that can’t be represented in less than 7 bits in binary.\n 36, as it’s the only one that isn’t a power of two.\n 32, as it’s the only one whose number of factors has more than one prime factor.\n 16, as it’s the only of the form [math]x^y[/math] where [math]x[/math] is an integer and [math]y[/math] is a number in the list.\n 8, as it’s the only one that doesn’t share a digit with any other number.\n 4, as it’s the only one that divides all of the other numbers on the list.\n Edit: Thanks to Adam Moxham for pointing out that 32 isn’t the only number which is the difference between two other numbers on the list.\n', 'I would say 8 and 32 because they are not squares of any whole number whereas the other 4 are; however, there really are many potential answers.

In fact, this equation is a classic example of a Pythagorean triple, where x, y, and z are integers that satisfy the equation. One well-known solution is (3, 4, 5), where 3² + 4² = 5². There are infinitely many such triples, and they have been studied extensively in number theory.\n\nAnswer 2:\nAbsolutely, the equation x² + y² = z² has positive integer solutions. This is known as a Pythagorean equation, and its solutions are called Pythagorean triples. One simple way to find solutions is to use the formula:\n- x = m² - n²\n- y = 2mn\n- z = m² + n²\nwhere m and n are positive integers with m > n. For example, if you take m = 2 and n = 1, you get the solution (3, 4, 5).\n\nAnswer 3:\nYes, it does. The equation x² + y² = z² is associated with Pythagorean triples, which are sets of three positive integers that satisfy this equation. One of the most famous examples is (3, 4, 5). Here, 3² + 4² equals 9 + 16, which is 25, the square of 5. So, (3, 4, 5) is a positive integer solution to the equation.

I’m going to call them dudes from now on.) who irrationally hate most women think they know what most women are like. That’s how they know who to hate; they’ve categorized us women into “women” and “bitches”. Their mother is likely a woman. That last girlfriend who fuckin’ cheated on him with his asshole best friend is a bitch.\n They have this internal checklist for the difference between women and bitches. It’s off topic for me to go into that, but you can guess, with things like, women are always beautiful and vivacious and quietly pleasant. Bitches are slutty and naggy and loud, etc.\n They even think they know how women and bitches talk or write. Things like, “Oh my god did you hear about Melanie? Like for reals, she was like, such a princess, like, can you even?!” or <A bunch of feminist discussion that may not even be offensive in any way.> They think females are social justice warriors, demure tools of the patriarchy, or act like teenagers.\n What about women who don’t do any of those? We confuse them. I had a guy on a dating site come to my dating profile (Before I got remarried, yo.) and his opening line to me was something like, “I don’t know why I’m bothering to talk to you! Women are bitches anyway and nobody will give me a chance!” So that’s how you start your pickups, dudebro?\n I shocked the shit out of him by not blocking him and by actually talking to him. His second volley was to wonder why I hadn’t blocked him like “all the other bitches out there”? I told him that I could feel his anger and understood it for what it was; he wasn’t mad at women, he was mad at rejection that just so happened to come from women.\n Long story short, I nearly got myself kicked out of the Sekrit Society of Wimmins by telling him how a lot of women think, that he was missing, and turned him around and sent him back out into the dating world. He thanked me for giving him a chance and trying to help him. Oh, and don’t ever let anyone tell you women don’t have basic rules amongst themselves or that the patriarchy makes them act that way. A lot of women act in packs or prides, like wolves or lions, and men have nothing to do with making them do that as it’s women who are the pack or pride enforcers! Seriously. No man or dude has ever verbally hurt me quite like a woman or bitch has. Aaaanyway.\n My entire time, my tone and language was much more boy/man/dude-like than girl/woman/bitch-like. Even this post you’re reading now doesn’t have any girly undertones or flowery language.\n What the whole above mess is getting to is that sometimes, by unintentionally not appearing like a stereotypical female caricature (I mean, few woman actually try to sound like mindless bimbos or high school “mean girls”), people don’t have your gender out as some kind of filter, like wearing sunglasses makes everything appear darker or greyer and knowing the writer is a “girl” makes all her writing seem more “girlish”. By the time they realize I’m a woman, they’ve already read my stuff and formed an opinion. It’s only after the fact if they toss in gender harassment.\n You might say, “But Lisa! your name is on your post! How could they not notice you’re female?” Hell, my wedding photo is there, too. But you know what? I don’t come to Quora to read “posts from women” or “posts from men” or “posts from pygmy spider moneys” or whatever. I come to Quora to read posts. Most of the time, I only look at the name of the poster after I’ve read what they say. If they don’t write with any stereotypical gender marker language, I’m unlikely to know what they are, and even less likely to care. That’s not my egalitarianism being all gender blind and magical and non-discriminatory. That’s my brain having no time to bother with the writer’s gender if it doesn’t seem to add anything to the answer they posted. I’ll certainly notice a man’s answer in a question directed specifically at women and will likely comment to him, “Dude, why are you trying to answer what women think when you’ve never been a woman?” Otherwise, I really don’t care all that much. If they write like a douchebag, however, I’ll note their gender so I can decide whether to think they’re a bastard or a bitch, since I can’t actually say that about them directly on Quora, but that’s usually my extent.\n I certainly do get criticized, but most of the time, it’s based on what I write, not what I am. Nobody’s ever commented on my answer with, “You’re just saying that because you’re female!” or some variant. Seriously. I don’t remember the last time I got such a sophomoric response. If someone says, “You’re just saying that because you’re a bitch!” I still don’t classify it as gendered hate speech, believe it or not. I still maintain they’re mad at my content and are just trying to poke me for it in whatever way they think will hurt or piss me off the most, but they didn’t feel my femaleness was the crux of what was wrong with my answer or comment or they would’ve made such thing more apparent.\n If someone ever spoke to me in comments and referenced my gender, it was usually because it was nearly central to my answer, such as for questions asking how women feel about something, like this question does. In those cases, their commentary, when it was negative, was still aimed at my content, not my gender. I wasn’t a bitch because I was female. I was a bitch because I said shit they didn’t like or agree with. Right or wrong, that, at least, is internally consistent. I can accept that. To mangle that Pantene shampoo commercial, “Don’t hate me because I’m female. Hate me because I said something sucky.” ;D\n This is, obviously, all just my own opinion and I do not speak for every woman out there everywhere.\n', 'Yes, they do get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora, but not because of the fact that they are female, but because people don’t agree with the contents of their questions and answers.\n I get harassed all the time for what I post and I am glad for that. It is the kind of harassment I am entitled to, and I would be crazy to demand being shielded from such harassment. I have a right to know what people think about what I think, even when they seem foaming at the mouth whilst expressing their thoughts.\n I have been female for half a century already. That is long enough to have learned that being female is quite a common occurrence among people, that doesn’t affect one’s humanity in any significant way. It means that I am as sensible, as compassionate and as intelligent as any male.\n Except when I am not.\n I can’t deny the fact that being a cunt about things is quite different from being a dick about things. There is of course a degree of overlap between the genders but that is entirely due to the fact that being a cunt or a dick about things invariably starts with being an asshole about things, and develops further from there.\n The perineal zone doesn’t present much of an obstacle in that respect.\n For some reason however, men seem to plateau at being an asshole for a while before they progress into being a dick, which means that they more often than women reach the end of their obnoxious momentum before their bullshit gets reinforced by gender-specific excretions.\n But that is but a minor detail.\n Gender differences in my experience are located exclusively in the stupid part of our being. For instance I have always found it impossible to determine the gender of the originator of something that is right, true, helpful, constructive or productive, but a fuck-up has the gender of the fucker-up written all over it.\n That is because when we are being stupid, we are leaking hormones all the time. Generic ones like adrenaline, melatonin, and insulin are always detectible after any major fail, but the gender-specific ones seem to constitute the dominant part of any sample of evidence recovered from the debris, as they precede the generic ones in the chain of causality leading up to any fuck-up.\n There are two kinds of additional stupid that accompany the main body of generic stupid: penile peasantry and vaginal vanity. I often cite ‘Let them eat shit’ and ‘Let them eat cake’ by way of distinguishing the male from the female surface layer of stupid that forms the abrasive crust enrobing the vast wealth of generic stupid we all possess.\n The result is the same: both idiots end up with their head stuck on a pitch fork or with their ass out of any position of power and/or influence. Because they don’t care. The difference between shit and cake is but one of decorum, as neither suggestion is meant to present a viable option. Both are expressions of criminal indifference to the wellbeing of others.\n Here is why gender doesn’t matter: it only seems to matter when something is the matter.\n', 'You know, when I first started out on Quora, I used to answer serious questions (many about immigration), and I got a lot of ""you don\'t know what the hell you\'re talking about"" comments from random people.  It enraged me, and I reported a few of the worst. One guy, in particular, went through my personal social media accounts, published information about me in a comment, and advised me to ""lawyer up"".  That seemed excessive.\n I don\'t get those kinds of comments much anymore, and I think a lot of it has to do with having high-quality followers who speak to my credibility.\n Sometimes it\'s hard to untangle the very real phenomenon of ""mansplaining"" from just getting ""know-it-alled"" on general principles.  A know-it-all attitude is common among Quora types.  I\'ve got my fair share of it myself.  Mansplaining is kind of a special microagression that looks a lot like being a know-it-all on the surface, until you start to notice that the only people who receive the ostensibly ""helpful"" comments are women.  It\'s something I would like to go away, but I expect we\'ll be dealing with it for years and decades to come, since even its perpetrators aren\'t aware just how foolish it is.\n More recently, I had a bit of a stalker/troll who was very keen on vandalizing my stuff.  Like all trolls, there\'s no way of knowing this person\'s identity, or whether they identify as male or female.  And it hardly matters.  Quora managed to shut it down in short order, for which I\'m very thankful.  I think that stalker was mainly targeting me based on my Quora visibility, not my sex or gender identity.\n So yeah, I think for the most part I\'ve been mercifully free of harassment based on gender.  Nothing that would really raise an eyebrow, anyway.  That being said, I\'ve seen it happen frequently to others.  Particularly those who write a lot about relationships.  And transwomen.  They get the worst of it.  \n It\'s an ongoing problem, and I\'d like to see the Quora team get ahead of it.  I believe that better trackability of anonymous user accounts and enhanced blocking features would be a good start.\n Edit:  Actually, I should add something.  One thing not mentioned in this question is people who post questions with the apparent intent of making Quora hostile to women.  I report and add limited distribution topics to these every day, but at times I feel like the Quora team could be much more proactive in following up.

Here are some actionable SEO tips that can help:\n\n### Comprehensive Keyword Research\nStart by identifying relevant keywords and phrases that align with your content and target audience. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, and Ahrefs can help you discover high-volume, low-competition keywords. Incorporate these keywords naturally into your website's content, meta tags, headings, and URLs to help search engines understand the purpose of your pages.\n\n### High-Quality Content Creation\nProducing valuable, engaging, and unique content is essential for achieving higher SERP rankings. Craft well-written articles, blog posts, and web pages that provide informative solutions to your audience's queries. Strive for comprehensive, long-form content that thoroughly covers a topic. Ensure your content is well-structured, incorporates relevant keywords, and includes visual elements such as images and videos to enhance user experience.\n\n### On-Page Optimization\nOptimizing your website's on-page elements helps search engines understand its relevance. Ensure your website has clear and descriptive title tags, meta descriptions, and headers that incorporate targeted keywords. Make sure your website is mobile-friendly, loads quickly, and has a user-friendly interface. Organize your content with logical URL structures and utilize schema mark-up to enhance visibility in search results.\n\n### Link Building\nBuilding high-quality backlinks from reputable websites is a crucial SEO strategy. Earn backlinks naturally by creating exceptional content that other websites will want to reference and share. Guest blogging, social media promotion, and influencer outreach can help you secure valuable backlinks. Remember, quality matters more than quantity, so focus on obtaining links from authoritative and relevant sources.\n\n### User Experience and Website Performance\nUser experience (UX) plays a vital role in SEO. Ensure your website is easy to navigate, with intuitive menus and clear call-to-action buttons. Optimize your website's loading speed by compressing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and leveraging browser caching. Mobile responsiveness is paramount, as an increasing number of users browse the internet on their smartphones. Google's algorithm prioritizes websites that offer seamless mobile experiences.\n\n### Social Media Presence\nWhile social media signals may not directly impact SERP rankings, a strong social media presence can indirectly improve your visibility and attract more traffic to your website. Engage with your audience on platforms relevant to your niche, share your content, and build a community around your brand. Social media shares can potentially lead to increased visibility and the acquisition of valuable backlinks.\n\n### Tools and Resources\nConsider using SEO tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz to track your rankings, conduct keyword research, and monitor your backlinks. These tools can provide valuable insights and help you stay ahead of the competition.\n\n### Adult-Specific Considerations\nGiven the nature of your website, be mindful of any restrictions or guidelines that search engines and advertising platforms may have regarding adult content. Focus on building a reputable brand and engaging with influencers in the adult industry to drive targeted traffic to your site.\n\nImplementing these SEO tips consistently and monitoring your progress will help you climb the SERP ladder, drive organic traffic, and achieve your online goals. Remember, SEO is an ongoing process that requires continuous adaptation to keep up with search engine algorithm updates and evolving user behaviors.\n\nGood luck with your SEO efforts!\n\n---"" response_metadata={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 2380, 'total_tokens': 3179, 'completion_tokens': 799}, 'model': 'mistral-large-latest', 'finish_reason': 'stop'} id='run-40600f05-d7fe-4e6d-a9b7-7aa9cc4d30cd-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2380, 'output_tokens': 799, 'total_tokens': 3179}",0.19169329073482427,0.19938650306748465,0.19546422754040846

It hosts about 3500 students, which is in no way a small number. I should mention that I'm a vegetarian.\n I wouldn't agree with separate basin or entrances to a mess based on eating patterns. It's unjustified, and absolutely doesn't prepare you for the future. I don't agree with different plates either, but can understand the concept for the sake of security.\n The argumemt in support is that a vegetarian person doesn't want to eat in a plate in which a nonvegetarian person had a meal. Fair argument, but it does nothing to justify separate entrances and basins. Separate eating areas are not justified by this, as seating on nearby tables doesn't transmit nonvegetarian - ism. Seating vegetarians and nonvegetarians in separate corners accomplishes nothing. It's not like nonvegetarians come and force you to eat nonveg if you are within 2 feet of them. Coming to the plates, I'd say they are washed after meal and then, you'll use them, so it does not matter what the person ate in it earlier. An opponent would argue that there is no guarantee how well it was cleaned, and so why take chances. My rebuttal is there is no surety that both the meals aren't cooked by the same person in the canteen. Even if they aren't, there is a significant possibility of some mixing in the canteen. If you choose to trust them there, why not trust here as well. I understand not everybody buys this, so yeah, I'm open to having separate plates, even though I, personally, find it unnecessary.\n As for the consequences, what happens when you get a job and you're having a lunch in your cubicle and Mr. Sharma in the nearby cubicle is having chicken. Do you go and ask him to have his lunch some other place? Do you ask the firm to have separate washrooms for vegetarians and nonvegetarians? How do you ask your manager to move you to another cubicle because the guy near you eats chicken? Wouldn't he ask if Mr. Sharma forced you to eat his chicken. How do you think he'll react when you say, “No, no. It's just that he eats chicken, you know.”\n Let me just mention that I don't think they're practicing untouchability, just stupidity. The untouchability angle is making a small issue too large. I think the best way is to do nothing. Let students eat wherever they want, with whoever they want. Just ensure that nobody is forced into anything. Have clear counters for veg and nonveg items so that people don't partake in nonveg items by mistake. Also, wash the damn plates properly, and everything will be alright.\n"", 'Modi and BJP and RSS/VHP actually prosper because of this attitude of the questioner and similar folks. He states that keeping a separate mess for vegetarians is equivalent of untouchability. I am reminded of 1994 my travel to a restaurant in Chicago with 4 Americans, 2male and 2 female. I was the only vegetarian. The server first served the vegetarian pizza and asked if I am done with my share, since he was going to use the same spatula to serve the non veg after that. He understands what vegetarian means in 1994 in USA and these MEAN guys want to force vegetarians to change themselves to the whims of non vegetarians.\n Congress has died thanks to its supporting such cheap persons. As a vegetarian I have the right to keep away from Non veg food. If I find you unclean I can keep away from you. If you call that untouchability then covid has taught all the lesson of containment zones and quarantine. Untouchability is when you treat someone inferior for his caste. In a public place one cannot ask for rights to keep away from others but again in a public place one cant be forced to eat non veg just because the non veg folks want you to eat their sxxx food. Dont take me wrong, infact non veg is sxxx since if you cut an animal or even a human the faeces float around the entire body.\n So stop talking about untouchability. That today does not exist but in some casteist villages. We have the so called LOW CASTE KINGS, who claim reservation and are rich and will like to force others to follow them (like the rich SC leader of Congress - Kharge) on one side and the VHP RSS which kills democracy by forcing people to be Modi bhakts. The common man is always fine in principle and suffers from both sides.\n The IIT episode as explained by some other gentleman below has obviously been blown up thanks to such Congress supported reservation seeking rich opportunists with no value system. Of course BJP is doing the same in the other side of the spectrum but for this question the questioner needs to be punished by his question being removed.\n PS. As some one said, look at Jains who dont take meat. Even I would not want the same plate to eat from for Veg and Non veg though that happens in many hostels.\n', 'I am not competent to write on the topic but, I have my own views for the readers’s consideration.\n A non-vegetarian, according to the prevalent tradition of South India, is not someone like a carnivore. They take vegetarian food, along with fish or meat as a side dish.\n The best way to solve the problem is to have separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian messes.\n A vegetarian mess would contain staff, who are vegetarians.\n From what I have read about the controversy, it is not practical for the management to implement the scheme. The next best scheme would be to have two kitchens and two eating areas in the canteen. This, again, amounts to having two separate canteens and therefore not practical.\n Then, a solution may be arrived at by considering the issue of cooking vessels and utensils. Unless these are made of terracotta, it is possible to clean them to a sterilised condition, without additional expenditure. (Terracotta vessels are ideal for turning milk into curd. Now, scholars can think if milk is a vegetarian or non-vegetarian item).\n So, let me suggest to use glazed ceramic utensils for cooking and serving vegetarian food and aluminium and stainless steel vessels for these purposes for vegetarian food. Original ceramic wares, called China, are expensive. But today, inexpensive, ceramic coated iron vessels of equally good glazing are available in the local markets.\n Now comes another problem. People, especially students, like to eat together with friends. So, let there be another section in the kitchen and dining area marked as Vegetarian cum Non-vegetarian area.\n I fail to understand the problem with washbasin taps. Indians usually eat with their right hand. While washing the hand, all of us use the dry left hand to open and close the tap.\n I have additional information to present. But, that will be based on the comments that I may get on this answer.\n I am a non-vegetarian. But I eat some types of fish and mutton or beef very rarely.\n']}, page_content=""question: IIT Madras mess has introduced separate entrance, utensils and basins for non-vegetarian students, some of whom are considering it as equivalent of 'untouchability'.

Since [math]8p[/math] is divisible by [math]4[/math], we only need to prove that [math]4p^4+1[/math] is divisible by [math]5[/math].

Moreover, since the polynomial can be factored as [math]n(n-2)(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)[/math], we conclude that it is also divisible by [math]3[/math] and by [math]6[/math]. Hence, when [math]n[/math] is even, the polynomial is also divisible by [math]240[/math]…!\n Case2, [math]n[/math] is odd: Then, there exists positive integer [math]p[/math] such that [math]n = 2p+1[/math] and our initial polynomial takes the form:\n [math]n^5–5n^3+4n = (2p+1)^5-5(2p+1)^3+4(2p+1) =[/math]\n [math]4p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) … (8)[/math]\n Now, since the final factored expression of our polynomial is divisible by [math]4[/math], we only need to show that the product [math]p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3)[/math] is divisible by [math]5[/math]. In order to prove this, we have:\n For [math]p ≡ 0mod5 => p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) ≡ 0mod5 ... (9)[/math]\n For [math]p ≡ 1mod5 => 2p+3 ≡ 0mod5 => [/math]\n [math]p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) ≡ 0mod5 … (10)[/math]\n For [math]p ≡ 2mod5 => 2p+1 ≡ 0mod5 => [/math]\n [math]p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) ≡ 0mod5 … (11)[/math]\n For [math]p ≡ 3mod5 => 2p-1 ≡ 0mod5 => [/math]\n [math]p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) ≡ 0mod5 … (12)[/math]\n For [math]p ≡ 4mod5 => p+1 ≡ 0mod5 =>  [/math]\n [math]p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) ≡ 0mod5 … (13)[/math]\n Therefore, by [math](9)[/math], [math](10)[/math], [math](11)[/math], [math](12)[/math] and [math](13)[/math], it follows that:\n [math]4p(2p-1)(p+1)(2p+1)(2p+3) ≡ 0mod20 => n^5–5n^3+4n ≡ 0mod20 ... (14)[/math]\n Moreover, even for the case at which [math]n[/math] is odd, since the polynomial can be factored as [math]n(n-2)(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)[/math], we conclude that it is also divisible by [math]6[/math]. Moreover, even for the case at which [math]n[/math] is odd, since the polynomial can be factored as [math]n(n−2)(n−1)(n+1)(n+2)[/math], then for any odd value of [math]n[/math], we observe that there are exactly two even numbers in the sequence [math]n−2[/math], [math]n−1[/math], [math]n[/math], [math]n+1[/math], [math]n+2[/math]. Hence, the polynomial is also divisible by [math]8[/math] and since it is also divisible by [math]3[/math] and [math]5[/math], it will also be divisible by [math]120[/math]. Hence, the polynomial is also divisible by [math]120[/math]…!\n Fifth proof (by induction):\n It is evident that for [math]n = 0[/math] the polynomial [math]n^5–5n^3+4n[/math] equals to zero and since zero is multiple of all numbers, we check for [math]n = 1[/math], [math]2[/math], [math]3[/math], and we have:\n For [math]n = 1 => n^5-5n^3+4n = 0 = (0)(20)[/math]\n For [math]n = 2 => n^5-5n^3+4n = 0 = (0)(20)[/math]\n For [math]n = 3 => n^5-5n^3+4n = 120 = (6)(20)[/math]\n We assume that for [math]n = k[/math]:\n [math]k^5-5k^3+4k = 20m ... (1)[/math]\n where [math]m[/math] is positive integer.\n We will prove that for [math]n = k+1[/math]:\n [math](k+1)^5-5(k+1)^3+4(k+1) = 20q … (2)[/math]\n where [math]q[/math] is positive integer.\n By [math](2)[/math], we take:\n [math](k+1)^5-5(k+1)^3+4(k+1) = [/math]\n [math](k^5+5k^4+10k^3+10k^2+5k+1)-5k^3-15k^2-15k-5+4k+4 = [/math]\n [math](k^5-5k^3+4k)+(5k^4+10k^3-5k^2-10k) ... (3)[/math]\n Now, since by [math](1)[/math] we know that [math]k^5–5k^3+4k[/math] is a multiple of [math]20[/math], we only have to show that [math]5k^4+10k^3-5k^2-10k[/math] is a mutiple of [math]20[/math].\n Now, the polynomial expression [math]5k^4+10k^3-5k^2-10k[/math] can be modified to:\n [math](5k^4-5k^2)+(10k^3-10k) = 5k^2(k^2-1)+10k(k^2-1) = [/math]\n [math](k^2-1)(5k^2+10k) = 5k(k+2)(k^2-1) = [/math]\n [math]5k(k+2)(k-1)(k+1) … (4)[/math]\n Now, the final factorization in (4) is a multiple of 5 and since the numbers n-1, n, n+1, n+2, are four consecutive integers, it follows that the product\n [math]5k(k+2)(k-1)(k+1)[/math]\n is also divisible by 4. Therefore, the final factorization in (4) is divisible by 20 and hence the proof by induction is now complete.\n', 'Several people have given a proof, but I haven’t seen anybody explain whether it is possible to prove without using mathematical induction. This question is somewhat a matter of interpretation, because we haven’t said yet what else one is allowed to use besides mathematical induction. It’s possible that the proofs given so far fit what was intended by a proof “not using” mathematical induction, because they use only other familiar results. I’ve heard professional mathematicians talk in this sort of loose way about what is “used” or “not used” in a proof, but to give a definite answer we need to say something more specifically about what other results we’re allowed to use. If we allow just anything, then we could use something (like the principle of infinite descent) that is equivalent to induction, but that would make the question meaningless.\n Roughly speaking, I would say that every proof of this result implicitly uses mathematical induction, because the ones that don’t mention it explicitly, use another result that was proven using mathematical induction.\n As far as I can tell everyone so far has used some cases of the remainder theorem, which says if d>0 then n can be written as qd+r where 0<=r<d, and I think the remainder theorem (or even just the special cases of d=4, 5, 20) can reasonably be described as only being provable using mathematical induction. It’s a little hard to see how else one would prove it.\n To back up my sense that one is always essentially using induction, let me describe a system that is something like the integers but in which the result fails. Consider the polynomials in x with integer coefficients. Let them have their usual addition and multiplication (of polynomials), and order them by saying p(x) > q(x) if the leading term of p(x)-q(x) is positive. The polynomials whose leading term is not negative (i.e. the elements of the system >=0) correspond to the natural numbers. There is a famous set of axioms for the natural numbers called Robinson arithmetic that is strong enough for Goedel’s incompleteness theorem to apply to it, but which is weak in some ways because it doesn’t have mathematical induction in it. The elements >=0 in this system satisfy the axioms of Robinson arithmetic as well as the commutative and associative laws for addition and multiplication. But it’s not possible to divide x by 5, even if we allow a remainder. The whole result is also not true in this model because (x^5–5x^3+4x)/20 doesn’t belong to it.\n Since this is a matter of interpretation, it’s conceivable that someone could come up with a different set of principles that seem fundamental, don’t include mathematical induction (or an equivalent principle) at all, and are enough to prove the remainder theorem (or the result in the question) but I don’t think they can. The remainder theorem is weaker than mathematical induction, so it is possible to assume it separately as an axiom, but I think it’s more appropriate to think of it as a consequence of induction than as a fundamental principle in its own right.\n', '[math]\\text{Let (n-2), (n -1), n, (n + 1), (n + 1) are any 5 consecutive integers for some}[/math]\n [math]\\text{n}\\,\\,\\in\\Z\\,\\,\\text{then without any proof  we can say their product}[/math]\n [math]\\text{is divisible by 5.}[/math]\n [math]\\therefore (n-2)(n-1)(n)(n + 1)(n + 2)\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}[/math]\n [math]\\implies n (n^2 - 1) (n^2 - 4)\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}[/math]\n [math]\\implies n (n^4 - 5 n^2 + 4)\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}[/math]\n [math]\\implies n^5 - 5 n^3 + 4 n\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}\\tag 1[/math]\n [math]\\text{similarly without any proof we can say that }[/math]\n [math]\\text{the product of five consecutive integers is divisible by 4.}[/math]\n [math]\\implies n^5 - 5 n^3 + 4 n\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}\\tag 2[/math]\n [math]\\text{if}\\,\\,a\\equiv b\\mod{m_1}\\quad \\text{and} \\quad a\\equiv b\\mod{m_2}[/math]\n [math]\\text{and if gcd}\\,\\,(m_1,m_2) = 1\\,\\,\\text{then}\\,\\,a\\equiv b\\pmod{m_1\\times m_2}[/math]\n [math]\\text{gcd (4, 5) = 1.

One way is to use the following formula:\nsum = n(n+1)/2\xa0\nwhere n is the number of terms in the series. In this case, n is 10, so the sum is equal to:\nsum = 10 * 11 / 2 = 55\xa0\nAnother way to calculate the sum is to add the first and last terms, then add the second and second-to-last terms, and so on. This will give you a series of five pairs of numbers, each of which adds up to 11. The sum of the series is then equal to 5 * 11 = 55.\n Finally, you can also use a calculator to calculate the sum.

This method is based on the fact that the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 9. In this case, the sum of the digits of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 45, which is divisible by 9. So, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is also divisible by 9. Since the sum of a multiple of 9 and another multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is equal to 9 times some number.

Here’s how it works:\n\n1. Start by adding the first and the last number together: \\(1 + 10 = 11\\).\n2. Next, add the second number and the second-to-last number: \\(2 + 9 = 11\\).\n3. Continue this pattern until you reach the middle numbers: \\(3 + 8 = 11\\), \\(4 + 7 = 11\\), and \\(5 + 6 = 11\\).\n\nSince there are 5 pairs of numbers, and each pair adds up to 11, you can multiply 11 by the number of pairs:\n\\[11 \\times 5 = 55\\].\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.\n\n### Method 2: Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series\nAnother method is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) \\]\nwhere \\(S\\) is the sum, \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\(n = 10\\) (the number of terms)\n- \\(a = 1\\) (the first term)\n- \\(l = 10\\) (the last term)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\\[ S = \\frac{10}{2} \\times (1 + 10) = 5 \\times 11 = 55 \\]\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.\n\n### Method 3: Simple Addition\nIf you prefer a more direct approach, you can simply add the numbers one by one:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55 \\]\n\nThis might take a bit longer, but it’s a clear and straightforward method.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll these methods lead to the same result: the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55. You can choose the method that you find easiest or most convenient. Whether you prefer pairwise addition, using a formula, or simple addition, each method will give you the correct answer.\n\nHope this helps! 👍\n\n---\n\nThis answer provides multiple approaches to solve the problem, making it accessible and easy to understand.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 1800, 'total_tokens': 2480, 'completion_tokens': 680}, 'model': 'mistral-large-latest', 'finish_reason': 'stop'} id='run-00ba6fde-d4c5-422c-acd6-db2794974577-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1800, 'output_tokens': 680, 'total_tokens': 2480}",0.33297297297297296,0.48663101604278075,0.3953982126104775
