Plus, his stamina is a bonus.\\n It was very hard to understand why Pep Guardiola played him in the wings and not midfield earlier.

Arguably, the 2 G.O.A.Ts.\\n As Rooney grew older, he started going deeper and deeper into the midfield looking for the ball whenever it wasn't in the opponents box. This left Manchester United without a centre forward during counter attacks.\\n Sir Alex Ferguson noticed this and started to buy centre forwards to play alongside Rooney. Berbatov, Chicharito, Tevez, Van Persie, etc. All were bought to play as out and out strikers, while Rooney led the creativity part in the No.10. A role he excelled at.\\n This led to Rooney's reduction in goal scoring but increased his assists and chances created.\\n Playing him in multiple positions as a utility player when someone was injured or out for one reason or another, didn't help much.\\n Many Manchester United fans who don't know much about football, felt Wayne Rooney was no longer a world class player.\\n The other issue is that Rooney's bulk physique couldn't allow him to play many years into his thirties. That's why he burnt out early and retired shortly after leaving Manchester United.\\n Despite all the odds being against him, he went on to become the greatest player in Manchester United history.\\n But make no mistake about it, Wayne Rooney was a monster of a player. At his best, no defender could contain him.\\n\", 'Who said he was the second best?\\n Jimmy Greaves, Gary Lineker and Harry Kane have far superior records playing for the England National Team.\\n Rooney’s problem was not that he was underrated but exactly the opposite. The English media built him up to be some kind of superman capable of leading the National team to glory despite the fact that in my view the likes of Gerrard were equally gifted.\\n Unfortunately, Wayne Rooney played his best football at a younger age when he still possessed those maverick qualities often seen in young players who play without fear. His finest tournament as an England player was his first one in Euro 2004. He scored one world cup goal in two world cups. Harry Kane scored six goals in this year’s world cup and people still feel he had a poor tournament.\\n', 'Wayne Rooney has been overrated for such a long time. He showed plenty of promise when he first broke onto the scene but he never really lived up to the expectation that he would reach the full potential everyone wanted. Where Cristiano Ronaldo worked hellishly to improve his game, Rooney didn’t seem to know how and plateaued, before going on a steady decline.\\n Maybe it was the money, the wife and family. Maybe it was the background and upbringing. Maybe it was the drinking, partying and smoking. Maybe he couldn’t handle the fame.\\n Whatever it was, his chapter in England is done.\\n']}, page_content=\"question: Why is Wayne Rooney so underrated when he's the second greatest English striker of all time?\"),\n"," Document(metadata={'top_answers': [\"What is the most important thing that you observed in the success of Cristiano Ronaldo?\\n If you had asked me this before, I would come with the same reasons as everyone else. Like, how he works hard or how he gives his everything. All these points are true and there is no denying that fact. But these reasons were right but never felt just right to me.\\n I mean take the example of his contemporaries : Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.\\nWayne Rooney gave his 200% on the field. Carlos Tevez was ready to give his everything on and off the field. Though, they were successful too but despite being almost similarly talented the difference between their success and Cristiano’s is significant. How an annoying young winger who dribbled way too much became one of the best in the entire history of football.\\n So one fateful day I saw a video of football pundits taking about him which I almost skipped because I thought they were gonna repeat the same reasons.\\nBut Matthew Syed, a british journalist and table tennis player, said these lines by taking Cristiano as prime example:\\nI think that these athletes are deeply paradoxical in that when they are on the stage and they have got a big match they have enough self belief to deliver, they execute brilliantly. But when on the training pitch they have the humility to say, “Even though I am good, I need to get better.” They work on their weaknesses. They build their weaknesses. They have their essential humbleness.\\nHe epitomizes these linee. In short, “Even Cristiano is arrogant in the football match, he is the most humble guy on the face of the Earth when it comes to training.”\\n And unlike many footballers, he accepted that this was the only way he would be the best at a very early age.\\n Tevez in an interview proved this point.\\nHe spends the entire day in the gym, it's an obsession. I remember that we needed to train at 9, I arrived at 8 and he was already there. So I tried to arrive at 7:30 and he was already there. One time I did everything to get there before him, I arrived at the pitch at 6:30, but he was already there. He was half asleep but there he was.”\\nThis humbleness is the price he pays for every arrogant gesture we all see on the camera.\\n[LINKED_TEXT: How has Cristiano Ronaldo transformed over the years? | Matthew Upson & Liam Rosenior | The Debate] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn-Y_Hoime8&t=258s]\\n [LINKED_TEXT: Carlos Tevez reveals the secret to Cristiano Ronaldo's career] [URL: https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/carlos-tevez-cristiano-ronaldo-messi-15140967]\\n Picture Credits: Google Images\\n\", \"He just doesn't give up…. that's his biggest pro\\n He trains and practices everyday without any leave, that is how he is one the best footballers on the planet even at the age of 35\\n\"]}, page_content='question: What is the most important thing that you observed in the success of Cristiano Ronaldo?')]"]},"execution_count":159,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["context_docs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Deprioritized as this one exhaust the free quota of the LLM\n","\n","#from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever\n","#retriever = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(\n","#    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), llm=llm\n","#)\n","\n","#unique_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(question_sample)\n","#len(unique_docs)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":160,"metadata":{"id":"dv0dftmYIsRh"},"outputs":[],"source":["# function to generate question answer pair\n","def generation_qa_pair(context_documents: list):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    This function takes in a list of retrieved docs and return string of question answer pair for the highest similar retrieved question\n","    \"\"\"\n","    question_answer_context=f\"\"\"Question: \\n {context_documents[0].page_content} \\n Answer Examples:\"\"\"\n","    for index, answer in enumerate(context_documents[0].metadata['top_answers']):\n","        question_answer_context = question_answer_context + f\"\"\"\\n\\n Answer {index+1}: \\n{answer}\"\"\"\n","\n","    return question_answer_context"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":161,"metadata":{"id":"kTahlZphGIDA"},"outputs":[],"source":["# load Prompt Template for Generation using RAGs\n","\n","prompt_rag = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n","    [\n","        (\n","            \"system\",\n","            \"You are expert in writing human like answers for an asked question.\",\n","        ),\n","        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),\n","    ]\n",")\n","\n","chain_rag = prompt_rag | llm"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":163,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"MT8ZhVDHgOYF","outputId":"a2145bef-c8f3-45bd-85c9-708c6fa4e470"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Genoa's Piatek could indeed fit in at AC Milan, given his impressive goal-scoring record and the Rossoneri's need for a reliable striker.
